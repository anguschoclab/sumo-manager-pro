3. Kenshō count computed
4. Sponsor banners allocated
5. Banner procession rendered
6. Bout winner declared
7. Kenshō split executed
8. Cash credited
9. Prestige updated
10. Sponsor cooldowns applied

---

## PART XIII — SOURCE PRESERVATION ANNEX

### Institutional Economy & Governance v2.0
```
# Stable Lords — Institutional Economy & Governance Canon v2.0 (Definitive)

Date: 2026-01-06  
Status: **Definitive Canon**  
Supersedes:
- Economy & Prestige v1.0–v1.5
- Governance V1.0–V1.3
- All intermediate economy / governance drafts

Scope:  
This document is the **single, harmonized source of truth** for how **money, prestige, governance, scandals, loans, supporters, kabu, mergers, and closures** function together in Stable Lords.

No features from prior documents are removed.  
Conflicts are resolved explicitly.  
All systems are deterministic, explainable, and replay-safe.

---

# PART I — ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS

## 1. Core Economic Philosophy

- Money is a **constraint**, not a score
- Prestige is a **force multiplier**, not currency
- Institutions survive via **stars, supporters, and sacrifice**
- Governance exists to protect legitimacy, not convenience

> Rank pays the wrestler.  
> Supporters sustain the stable.  
> Governance decides who is allowed to continue.

---

## 2. Currency & Time Cadence

- Currency: ¥ (yen-equivalent)
- No inflation by default
- Cadence:
  - **Weekly**: beya operating costs
  - **Monthly**: salaries, allowances, oyakata salaries, kōenkai income, loan payments
  - **Per-bout**: kenshō settlement
  - **Basho-end**: awards, promotions, prestige decay, governance review

---

## 3. Economic Accounts (Non-Mergeable)

- LeagueTreasury (abstract)
- BeyaOperatingFund
- RikishiCash
- RikishiRetirementFund
- OyakataPersonalFund

Funds never move between accounts unless explicitly defined.

---

# PART II — RIKISHI PAY & PRESTIGE

## 4. Rikishi Salaries (League-Paid, Monthly)

| Rank | Monthly Salary |
|---|---:|
| Yokozuna | ¥3,000,000 |
| Ōzeki | ¥2,500,000 |
| Sekiwake | ¥1,800,000 |
| Komusubi | ¥1,700,000 |
| Maegashira | ¥1,400,000 |
| Jūryō | ¥1,100,000 |

- Paid monthly
- Never enters beya funds
- 10% automatically diverted to retirement fund

---

## 5. Lower Division Allowances (Monthly)

| Division | Allowance |
|---|---:|
| Makushita | ¥150,000 |
| Sandanme | ¥90,000 |
| Jonidan | ¥55,000 |
| Jonokuchi | ¥35,000 |

Purpose: subsistence, not accumulation.

---

## 6. Kenshō Banners

- ¥70,000 per banner
- 50% → rikishi
- 50% → beya operating fund
- Paid immediately per bout
- 30% of rikishi share diverted to retirement fund

Banner counts are deterministic based on prestige, bout importance, and basho context.

---

## 7. Prestige System (Unified)

Prestige exists at:
- Rikishi level
- Beya level

Prestige drives:
- kenshō frequency
- kōenkai strength
- recruitment quality
- narrative prominence
- AI valuation

Decay (per basho):
- Rikishi: 2–4%
- Beya: 1–2%
- Floors apply

---

# PART III — BEYA ECONOMY

## 8. Beya Operating Costs (Weekly)

| Expense | Formula |
|---|---|
| Wrestlers | ¥2,000 × roster |
| Staff | ¥6,000 × staff |
| Facilities | ¥1,000 × facility levels |

These costs are unavoidable.

---

## 9. Retirement Funds

Sources:
- 10% of salary/allowance
- 30% of kenshō winnings

Uses at retirement:
- cash payout
- coaching certification
- kabu acquisition
- succession buy-in

Funds are locked until retirement.

---

# PART IV — SUPPORTERS, OYAKATA & RESCUE

## 10. Kōenkai / Supporters Associations

| Strength | Monthly Income |
|---|---:|
| None | ¥0 |
| Weak | ¥50,000 |
| Moderate | ¥150,000 |
| Strong | ¥400,000 |
| Powerful | ¥800,000 |

Strength evolves deterministically with prestige, success, scandal, and leadership stability.

---

## 11. Oyakata Economics

### 11.1 Oyakata JSA Salary (Monthly)

| Status | Salary |
|---|---:|
| Standard Oyakata | ¥1,000,000 |
| Senior Committee | ¥1,300,000 |
| Executive (Riji) | ¥1,600,000+ |

Paid to OyakataPersonalFund.

---

### 11.2 Personal Subsidies

- Optional
- Triggered at Stressed / Critical
- Monthly cap (¥100k–¥500k)
- Finite
- No prestige gain

Overuse weakens succession and increases collapse risk.

---

## 12. Loans & Benefactors (Insolvency Rescue)

Available only at **Critical** or **Insolvent**.

### Loan Types
1. Emergency Loan (0%, short-term, restrictive)
2. Supporter Loan (2–4%, medium-term, autonomy loss)
3. Benefactor Bailout (5–8%, long-term, governance leverage)

Missed payments escalate deterministically to sanctions, mergers, or closure.

Loans apply **binding strings** and prestige penalties.

---

# PART V — GOVERNANCE & SCANDALS

## 13. Kabu (Elder Stock)

- Finite global pool
- Required to operate a beya
- Non-dividend
- Revocable under sanction
- Escrowed during succession or merger

Loss of kabu = immediate loss of eligibility.

---

## 14. Council Decision Engine

Triggers:
- Insolvency
- Loan default
- Scandal thresholds
- Succession failure
- Welfare violations

Pipeline:
1. Trigger detected
2. State snapshot
3. Rule evaluation
4. Mandatory ruling
5. Media narrative
6. Permanent record

No randomness.

---

## 15. Scandals & Ethics

Scandals accumulate as state:
- Financial misconduct
- Ethical violations
- Institutional misrepresentation
- Narrative exposure

Thresholds trigger:
- Council Watch
- Investigation
- Crisis
- Structural action

---

## 16. Sanction Ladder

1. Warning
2. Fines
3. Restrictions
4. Forced change
5. Merger or closure

Scandals accelerate but never bypass steps.

---

## 17. Media & Narrative Layer

Media translates governance rulings into:
- headlines
- investigations
- retrospectives

Media effects:
- prestige decay acceleration
- kōenkai weakening
- recruitment penalties

Media never invents outcomes.

---

## 18. Governance UI & History

Every beya has:
- live governance status panel
- visible sanctions and restrictions
- permanent ruling ledger

No hidden punishments. No surprise closures.

---

# PART VI — STRUCTURAL OUTCOMES

## 19. Stable Mergers

Deterministic resolution:
- surviving beya selected
- facilities partially absorbed
- roster conflicts resolved
- prestige partially transferred
- identity retired

Scandal reduces favorable outcomes.

---

## 20. Forced Closures

Triggered by:
- kabu loss
- unrecoverable insolvency
- terminal scandal

Closure is permanent and archived.

---

## 21. AI Behavior Summary

AI managers:
- track runway, scandal risk, governance status
- adjust spending and training
- plan succession earlier under pressure
- may resign pre-removal

Profiles affect timing, not rules.

---

## 22. Determinism Contract

Given identical:
- seed
- decisions
- timelines

Outcomes are identical.

---

## 23. Final Canon Statement

> **Stable Lords is not about winning bouts.  
> It is about whether an institution deserves to survive the consequences of winning them.**

---

End of Definitive Canon v2.0

```

### Procedural Sponsors Canon v1.0
```
# Stable Lords — Procedural Sponsors, Kenshō & Supporters Canon v1.0
## Definitive Interaction Spec (Economy × Governance × Beya × Narrative)

Date: 2026-01-10  
Status: **Canonical, verbose, implementation-grade**  
Purpose: Add a **fully deterministic, procedural sponsor system** that supports:
- **Kenshō / banner assignment** (per-bout)
- **Beya supporters (Kōenkai) funding** (monthly)
- **Benefactors & loans** (insolvency rescue escalation)
- **Media / governance visibility** (scandals, sanctions, decision history)

This document is intentionally **not high level**. It includes explicit data contracts, generation rules, and execution order.

---

# 0) Canon Anchors & Supersession Notes

This spec is designed to **plug into** (and remain compatible with) existing canon:
- Institutional Economy & Governance Canon v2.0 (money cadence, accounts, kenshō split, kōenkai tiers, loans, governance triggers)  
- Governance v1.3 (sanctions ladder, media layer, decision history UI, kabu constraints)  
- Institutional Interaction Contract v1.0 (tick order, shared objects, determinism, visibility rules)  
- Beya Management v1.0 (foreign slot rules, roster economics, management loop)

It **does not change** any yen values already canonized:
- Kenshō value and splits remain economy-owned.
- Kōenkai monthly income bands remain economy-owned.
- Loans and repayment schedules remain economy-owned.

Instead, this spec provides the missing **entity layer**:
> Who the sponsors are, how they are created, how they recur, and how they attach to banners and supporters.

---

# 1) Design Principles (Binding)

## 1.1 Determinism Above All
Given identical:
- world seed
- player decisions
- match outcomes

…sponsor identities, banner assignment, sponsor churn, and supporter rosters are identical.

## 1.2 No “Random Sponsor Magic”
Sponsors do not “appear” without cause. They are generated from:
- the world seed
- baseline economy settings
- league/basho context
- prestige and narrative visibility

## 1.3 Sponsors Never Affect Combat
Sponsors influence:
- **presentation** (banner names, ceremony flavor)
- **economy routing** (kenshō sources and kōenkai entities)
- **narrative pressure** (visibility, scandal scrutiny)

They **never**:
- modify bout results
- modify injury probability
- modify training outcomes

## 1.4 Presentation Is Mostly Qualitative
PBP and UI should generally avoid numeric reporting, **except for hard economy numbers** (yen, runway weeks), consistent with narrative-first canon.

---

# 2) Core Concept: One Sponsor System, Three Surfaces

A single sponsor entity can participate in one or more surfaces:

1) **Kenshō Sponsor** (per-bout banners)  
2) **Kōenkai Member** (monthly supporters association for a beya)  
3) **Benefactor / Creditor** (loans/bailouts during distress)

The same corporate name may show up on banners, be listed as a kōenkai pillar, and later be the entity offering a bailout—**without inventing a new identity**.

---

# 3) Canonical Sponsor Data Contracts

## 3.1 Sponsor Entity (Persistent World Object)
```ts
Sponsor {
  sponsorId: SponsorID
  displayName: string              // "Hokuto Logistics"
  shortName?: string               // "Hokuto"
  category: SponsorCategory
  tier: SponsorTier
  originRegionId: RegionID
  industryTag: IndustryTag
  toneTag: "traditional" | "modern" | "luxury" | "local" | "industrial" | "civic"
  
  // Hidden simulation traits (never fully shown to player)
  prestigeAffinity: number         // 0..100  (how strongly they chase prestige)
  loyalty: number                  // 0..100  (how sticky once attached)
  scandalTolerance: number         // 0..100  (how long before they withdraw)
  riskAppetite: number             // 0..100  (likelihood to become lender/benefactor)
  visibilityPreference: 0..2       // 0=quiet, 1=normal, 2=high-visibility
  
  // Dynamic state
  active: boolean
  createdAtTick: TickID
  lastSeenTick: TickID
  relationships: SponsorRelationship[]
}
```

## 3.2 Sponsor Relationship (Links to Entities)
```ts
SponsorRelationship {
  relId: string
  sponsorId: SponsorID
  targetType: "league" | "basho" | "beya" | "rikishi"
  targetId: string
  role: "kensho" | "koenkai_member" | "koenkai_pillar" | "benefactor" | "creditor"
  strength: 1..5                   // qualitative (not exposed as number)
  startedAtTick: TickID
  endsAtTick?: TickID
  notesTag?: string                // short classifier used by narrative engine
}
```

## 3.3 Sponsor Tier (For Identity & Cadence Only)
Sponsor tiers govern:
- how often they appear as kenshō banners
- whether they can become kōenkai pillars
- whether they can offer loans/bailouts
- how visible they are in media coverage

They do **not** set yen amounts directly (economy does that).

| Tier | Label | Canonical Meaning | Typical Surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| T0 | Micro | One-off local name; appears rarely | Kenshō only |
| T1 | Local | Recurring local sponsor; quiet | Kenshō + occasional kōenkai |
| T2 | Regional | Regular banners; may join kōenkai | Kenshō + kōenkai member |
| T3 | National | Strong visibility; pillar candidate | Kenshō + kōenkai pillar |
| T4 | Legacy | “Institutional” sponsor; prestige-chaser | High banners + pillars |
| T5 | Benefactor-Class | Rare; bailout-capable | Loans / rescue + high visibility |

---

# 4) Procedural Sponsor Generation (Explicit)

## 4.1 Global Sponsor Pool Construction
Sponsor generation occurs in three moments:

1) **World Generation (Initial Pool)**
2) **Seasonal Expansion (Basho 1 of each year)**
3) **Reactive Generation (Triggered by major prestige spikes)**

### 4.1.1 Initial Pool Size (Deterministic)
At worldgen:
- Generate a baseline pool sized to league scale.
- Recommended: `S = 180 + (WorldSizeScalar × 60)`  
  (WorldSizeScalar is a global constant; if absent, set to 1.)

Split by tier at creation:
- T0: 35%
- T1: 25%
- T2: 20%
- T3: 12%
- T4: 7%
- T5: 1%

### 4.1.2 Seasonal Expansion
At Basho #1 each in-game year:
- Add `ceil(S * 0.05)` new sponsors
- Bias toward T0–T2 unless league prestige is historically high

### 4.1.3 Reactive Generation
If a basho produces:
- a Yokozuna promotion, or
- a new “defining rivalry” headline event, or
- a scandal of severity ≥4 (attention spike)

Then add a small number of sponsors:
- +3 to +9 generated sponsors (exact count deterministic from event hash)
- Mix includes higher-tier “attention chasers” in prestige booms
- Mix includes cautious “quiet” sponsors in scandal booms

## 4.2 Deterministic Name Generation (Robust)
Names are generated from curated component lists and a deterministic selector.
No external brands. No real companies.

### 4.2.1 Name Components
- Prefix pool (regional / cultural / phonetic)
- Core pool (industry nouns)
- Suffix pool (Co., Group, Holdings, Foundation, Works, Foods, Lines)
- Optional honorific pool (rare; used for Legacy sponsors)

### 4.2.2 Name Assembly Rules
Each sponsor chooses one pattern by tier:

**T0–T2 patterns**
- "{Prefix} {Core}"
- "{Core} {Suffix}"
- "{Prefix} {Core} {Suffix}"

**T3–T4 patterns**
- "{Prefix} {Core} {Suffix}"
- "{Prefix}-{Core} {Suffix}"
- "{Core} {Suffix} {DivisionTag}" (e.g., “Sports” “Logistics” “Cultural”)

**T5 patterns**
- "{FamilyName} {Foundation}"
- "{Prefix} {Core} {Holdings}"
- "{Core} {LegacySuffix}"

### 4.2.3 Collision & Uniqueness
- Use a stable normalization key (lowercase, remove punctuation, collapse spaces).
- If collision occurs:
  1) append a deterministic region tag
  2) if collision persists, append a 2-digit deterministic disambiguator (“II”, “03”)

## 4.3 Category, Region, and Trait Assignment
Trait assignment is deterministic from:
`hash(worldSeed, sponsorId)`

### 4.3.1 Category Distribution (Recommended)
- Local Business: 30%
- Regional Corporation: 20%
- National Brand (fictional): 12%
- Alumni Association: 10%
- Cultural Foundation: 10%
- Private Benefactor: 12%
- Anonymous Patron: 6% (high scandal tolerance, low visibility)

### 4.3.2 Trait Ranges by Tier
Higher tier tends to correlate with:
- higher prestigeAffinity
- higher visibilityPreference
- higher riskAppetite (especially T5)

Example deterministic mapping:
- T0: prestigeAffinity 10–35, loyalty 10–40
- T2: prestigeAffinity 25–60, loyalty 30–70
- T4: prestigeAffinity 50–90, loyalty 50–95
- T5: prestigeAffinity 70–100, riskAppetite 60–100

---

# 5) Kenshō Sponsor Assignment (Per-Bout, Explicit)

## 5.1 Separation of Concerns
Economy computes:
- bannerCount (0..N) deterministically
- yen value per banner
- split to rikishi/beya

This sponsor system computes:
- which sponsors “own” each banner for ceremony + UI
- sponsor recurrence patterns
- sponsor-tier-appropriate selection

## 5.2 Banner Slots Model
Each banner is a slot:
```ts
KenshoBannerSlot {
  bannerId: string
  boutId: BoutID
  sponsorId: SponsorID
  tier: SponsorTier
  displayName: string
  ceremonyStyleTag: "classic" | "premium" | "quiet"
}
```

## 5.3 Sponsor Selection Algorithm (Deterministic)
Inputs:
- bout importance signals (rank band, day, yūshō contention)
- combined prestige (rikishi + beya)
- basho prestige baseline
- sponsor pool state (active sponsors, lastSeen, loyalty relationships)

### 5.3.1 Candidate Set Construction
Start with all active sponsors, then apply filters:
- Exclude sponsors on boycott status (see §9)
- Exclude sponsors currently “locked” to a scandal target (if they have withdrawn)
- Exclude sponsors that would violate tier caps for the bout (below)

### 5.3.2 Bout Tier Budget (Explicit Caps)
Each bout computes a “tier budget” from its importance bucket:

| Bout Importance Bucket | Max T4+ banners | Max T3 banners | Default mix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Low (lower maegashira / juryo) | 0 | 1 | mostly T0–T2 |
| Mid (upper maegashira) | 1 | 2 | T1–T3 |
| High (sanyaku / contention) | 2 | 4 | T2–T4 |
| Peak (yūshō playoff / yokozuna bout) | 4 | 6 | allows T5 (rare) |

### 5.3.3 Weighting (No RNG)
Each candidate sponsor receives a score:
```
score =
  baseTierWeight(tier)
+ affinityWeight(prestigeAffinity, boutPrestige)
+ recencyBonus(lastSeenTick)
+ relationshipBonus(if sponsor already linked to rikishi/beya)
- scandalPenalty(if sponsor is scandal-sensitive and target is under scrutiny)
```
Selection uses **sorted score** + deterministic tie-breaker (sponsorId order).

### 5.3.4 Reuse vs Variety
To prevent repetition:
- apply a **cooldown**: sponsors used in the last X bouts (broadcast scope) are penalized
- apply a **per-basho cap**: no sponsor may occupy more than Y% of all banners in a basho

Defaults (tunable, deterministic):
- cooldown window: 12 bouts
- per-basho cap: 4% of total banners

## 5.4 Ceremony & PBP Hooks
For bouts with banners:
- The banner procession uses sponsor display names (or shortName for commentary).
- PBP references sponsor(s) **without sounding like an ad**:
  - “A line of sponsor banners circles the dohyo—names familiar to the faithful…”
  - “The envelopes are prepared…”

The PBP layer may select:
- one “headline sponsor” (highest tier among assigned) to mention explicitly
- all sponsors to show in UI list

---

# 6) Kōenkai / Beya Supporters Integration (Formal)

## 6.1 What Kōenkai Is in This Model
A beya’s Kōenkai becomes a **container of sponsor relationships**.

```ts
Koenkai {
  koenkaiId: string
  beyaId: BeyaID
  strengthBand: "none"|"weak"|"moderate"|"strong"|"powerful"
  members: SponsorRelationship[]   // role=koenkai_member|koenkai_pillar
  createdAtTick: TickID
  lastChangedTick: TickID
}
```

Economy still maps strengthBand → monthly yen income.

## 6.2 Kōenkai Formation (Deterministic)
A beya without kōenkai may form one when:
- beya prestige exceeds a threshold band for ≥2 basho, OR
- it hosts a sekitori for ≥1 basho, OR
- it wins a major trophy (yūshō / sanshō cluster)

When triggered:
- select 3–7 sponsors from the global pool
- bias toward sponsors in the beya’s region and category “local business / alumni”
- add 0–1 higher-tier sponsor if prestige is high

## 6.3 Kōenkai Member vs Pillar
- **Members**: normal supporters; may come and go.
- **Pillars**: 1–2 key sponsors; define identity and stabilize income.

Rules:
- Weak/Moderate: 0–1 pillar
- Strong/Powerful: 1–2 pillars
- Pillars must be tier ≥T2 (recommended) and typically ≥T3 for Powerful

## 6.4 Kōenkai Drift (Growth/Decay) with Entity Logic
Existing canon says kōenkai strength evolves deterministically with prestige, success, scandal, and stability.
This spec makes that *concrete*:

### 6.4.1 Upgrade / Downgrade Test (Basho-End)
At basho-end:
1) compute beya prestige trend bucket: rising / flat / falling
2) check scandal tier (qualitative)
3) check leadership stability (succession uncertainty, governance watch)
4) update kōenkai strengthBand by at most **one step**

### 6.4.2 Membership Churn Rules
When strength changes:
- upgrade: add 1–3 new members; possibly promote a member → pillar
- downgrade: remove 1–3 members; possibly demote a pillar (rare, but possible under scandal)

Churn is deterministic:
- remove lowest loyalty or lowest scandalTolerance first
- add highest affinity/region match sponsors first

---

# 7) Benefactors, Loans, and Sponsor Escalation (Bridging v1.5 → v2.0)

## 7.1 Sponsor → Benefactor Escalation Path
Under distress (Critical/Insolvent), economy may offer loans (Emergency / Supporter / Benefactor).
This spec defines how the provider identity is chosen:

### 7.1.1 Emergency Loan Provider
- providerType = league
- provider is not a Sponsor entity (it is the institution)
- no sponsor name attached

### 7.1.2 Supporter Loan Provider
- providerType = koenkai
- provider is the beya’s Kōenkai container (not a single sponsor)
- optionally attribute “led by {PillarSponsor}” in narrative

### 7.1.3 Benefactor Bailout Provider
- providerType = benefactor
- must be a sponsor entity tier ≥T4, or upgraded to T5
- selection priority:
  1) existing kōenkai pillar with highest riskAppetite
  2) existing banner sponsor with strongest relationship to beya
  3) global pool highest prestigeAffinity sponsor matching region

When a sponsor provides a bailout:
- set tier to T5 if not already
- create relationship role=benefactor
- set visibilityPreference to high (they want to be seen—or cannot avoid being seen)

## 7.2 “Strings” as Restrictions (Integration Contract)
Loan strings become Restriction objects as canon:
- recruitment_ban
- foreign_slot_lock
- upgrade_lock
- merger_block

Sponsor-provided loans must store:
- sponsorId as the Restriction source metadata
- plain-language UI explanation referencing sponsor name

---

# 8) Media & Governance Interactions (Sponsor-Aware)

## 8.1 Sponsor Sensitivity to Scandal
Each sponsor has scandalTolerance.
When a beya enters a scandal tier:
- sponsors evaluate continued affiliation at basho-end (or at ruling time for severe events)

Withdrawal is deterministic:
- if scandal severity exceeds tolerance band:
  - end relationship(s) at nextTick
  - apply a “boycott flag” for a cooldown window (cannot appear as banner sponsor)
  - downgrade kōenkai strength if pillars withdraw

## 8.2 Council Actions that Mention Sponsors
Governance rulings do not “punish sponsors,” but may reference:
- “Supporters withdraw” (kōenkai downgrade)
- “Benefactor influence” (loan strings, autonomy loss)

These appear in:
- media events (headline phrases)
- governance decision history ledger

## 8.3 Sponsor Visibility in Governance UI
UI must show (player-facing):
- list of current kōenkai pillars (names)
- if the stable is funded by a benefactor bailout (name)
- if banners have a “headline sponsor” (name)
- general sponsor withdrawal status (“Supporters cooling”)

UI must not show:
- loyalty numbers
- scandalTolerance values
- sponsor selection weights

---

# 9) Sponsor Lifecycle: Exit, Merge, Rebrand

## 9.1 Sponsor Exit
Sponsors can exit the world (becoming inactive) when:
- low loyalty + repeated non-selection
- major scandal association
- or a deterministic time-to-live expires for small local sponsors

Exit rules:
- T0 sponsors may expire after 1–3 years
- T3+ almost never expire (they “stick around”)
- inactive sponsors remain in history logs

## 9.2 Rebrand (Optional, Deterministic)
For sponsors in T1–T3:
- if they upgrade tier twice within 2 years, they may rebrand:
  - “{Name}” → “{Name} Holdings” or “{Name} Group”

Rebrand preserves sponsorId (identity continuity).

## 9.3 Stable Merger / Closure Handling
If a beya merges or closes:
- kōenkai dissolves (container ends)
- sponsor relationships either:
  - migrate to merged beya at reduced strength (only if loyalty high), or
  - end and return to global pool

Benefactor relationships do not migrate automatically; they require governance approval.

---

# 10) Execution Order (Authoritative)

This section extends the existing deterministic tick order with sponsor steps.

## 10.1 Monthly Tick (Insertion Points)
1. Salaries & allowances paid  
2. Kōenkai contributions applied  
3. Loan repayments processed  
4. Oyakata subsidies evaluated  
5. **Sponsor lifecycle pass** (churn, exits, rebrands)  
6. Media follow-ups generated  
7. Governance restrictions revalidated  

## 10.2 Bout Resolution (Insertion Points)
1. Combat resolves  
2. **Kenshō bannerCount computed (economy)**  
3. **Sponsor assignment fills banner slots (this doc)**  
4. Kenshō applied (economy split)  
5. Rivalry updated  
6. Prestige updated  
7. Media event queued  

## 10.3 Basho-End Resolution (Insertion Points)
After awards and prestige decay:
- run kōenkai drift (upgrade/downgrade)
- run sponsor withdrawal checks if scandal tier changed
- write sponsor history logs

---

# 11) Logging & Auditability (Non-Negotiable)

Every sponsor-related event must emit an immutable log row:
- sponsorId
- action type (created, used_as_banner, joined_koenkai, withdrew, became_benefactor, rebranded, exited)
- target entity (boutId/beyaId)
- tickId
- reasonTag (short, deterministic classifier)

This ensures replay safety and QA visibility.

---

# 12) Minimal UI Requirements (Concrete)

## 12.1 Kenshō Overlay
- shows banner procession
- shows sponsor names list (scrollable)
- highlights “headline sponsor” (if any)
- shows ceremonial envelope moment (no numeric split shown)

## 12.2 Beya Supporters Panel
- kōenkai strength band (word)
- pillar sponsors (names)
- member count (optional)
- recent changes: “A pillar withdrew after scrutiny” (qualitative)

## 12.3 Financial Warnings (Sponsor-Aware)
When approaching Critical:
- warn if kōenkai is weak and volatile
- warn if pillars have low scandal tolerance (not as numbers—use text)
- warn if bailout likely implies autonomy loss

# 13) Canon Phrases (Narrative Safe)

Use sponsor-aware phrasing that does not feel like marketing:
- “A familiar banner returns to the ring’s edge.”
- “Local names, long supporters of this stable.”
- “A pillar of backing stands behind them tonight.”
- “The envelopes wait—earned, not granted.”
- “Support is present… but watchful.”

Avoid:
- “Buy” “sale” “discount” “best” (no ad language)

---

# 14) Implementation Checklist (Concrete)

- [ ] Worldgen creates Sponsor pool with tier distribution and unique names  
- [ ] Sponsor selection fills KenshōBannerSlots per bout deterministically  
- [ ] Kōenkai is a container of SponsorRelationships with member/pillar roles  
- [ ] Kōenkai drift updates band + churns members deterministically at basho-end  
- [ ] Benefactor identity selection follows escalation rules and upgrades to T5  
- [ ] Sponsor withdrawal/boycott integrates with scandal tiers and governance rulings  
- [ ] UI surfaces sponsor names and supporter identity without exposing hidden numbers  
- [ ] All sponsor events are logged for replay/audit  

---

# 15) Canon One-Liner

> **In Stable Lords, sponsors are not buffs—they are the visible proof that prestige can be converted into support, and that support can be withdrawn when legitimacy cracks.**

### Beya Staff & Welfare Canon v1.1
```

# Stable Lords — Beya Management, Staff Careers & Welfare Canon v1.1
## Ultra-Granular Institutional Operations Specification

Status: DEFINITIVE  
Scope: Stable operations, staff careers, welfare & medical liability  
Guarantee: Non-lossy, larger than source material, implementation-grade

This document **merges and supersedes**:
- Beya Management System v1.0
- Staff Careers & Institutional Roles Canon v1.0
- Injury / Welfare–related portions of Rikishi Development Canon v1.3

It resolves overlaps, wires systems together explicitly, and preserves all original text in annexes.

---

# PART I — DESIGN AXIOMS (INSTITUTIONAL SCOPE)

1. **A beya is an employer**, not a menu of bonuses.  
2. **Staff are people with careers**, not sliders.  
3. **Welfare failures have institutional consequences**, not isolated penalties.  
4. **Medical outcomes are deterministic and attributable.**  
5. **Negligence is remembered.**

---

# PART II — BEYA AS AN OPERATING INSTITUTION

## 2. Beya Operational State Model

```ts
BeyaOperationalState {
  beyaId
  facilitiesBand
  staffRoster: StaffId[]
  medicalCoverageBand
  welfareRiskBand
  complianceStatus
  governanceExposure
  operatingStress
}
```

Each field updates on weekly or monthly ticks.

---

## 3. Core Responsibilities of a Beya

A beya is responsible for:
- training safety
- medical care
- injury response
- compliance with governance norms
- staff workload management

Failure in any category produces **institutional risk**, not hidden debuffs.

---

# PART III — STAFF CAREERS (INTEGRATED)

# Stable Lords — Staff Careers & Institutional Roles Canon v1.0
## Ultra-Granular, Integrated Specification (Implementation Grade)

This document **adds a full Staff Career system** and integrates it explicitly with:
- Beya Management
- NPC Manager AI
- Economy & Governance
- Training & Rikishi Development
- Succession, Scandals, and Narrative Memory

It is designed to be **non–high-level**, deterministic, and larger than its source inputs.

---

## PART I — DESIGN INTENT

Staff in Stable Lords are **not modifiers**.
They are **people with careers**, incentives, reputations, fatigue, and failure states.

Staff careers exist to:
- create long-term continuity beyond rikishi careers
- introduce institutional memory
- constrain player optimization
- create succession and governance pressure
- generate narrative arcs (loyal aides, disgraced doctors, legendary coaches)

---

## PART II — STAFF ROLES (CANONICAL)

### 1. Staff Categories

| Role | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Oyakata | 1 | Required, governed by kabu |
| Assistant Oyakata | 0–2 | Succession + delegation |
| Technique Coach | 0–2 | Skill bias |
| Conditioning Coach | 0–2 | Fatigue & injury bias |
| Nutritionist | 0–1 | Weight stability |
| Medical Staff | 0–2 | Injury severity & recovery |
| Scout | 0–1 | Recruitment & info quality |
| Administrator | 0–1 | Economy & governance mitigation |

No role is optional in effect — absence is a penalty.

---

## PART III — STAFF ENTITY MODEL

### 2. Staff Object (Persistent)

## PART IV — CAREER PHASES

### 3. Staff Career Phases

| Phase | Effects |
|---|---|
| Apprentice | Low impact, high growth |
| Established | Full effectiveness |
| Senior | Stable but rigid |
| Declining | Error-prone |
| Retired | Succession only |

Career phase advances deterministically by age, workload, and scandal.

---

## PART V — STAFF EFFECTS (WIRED)

### 4. Integration Points

#### 4.1 Training
- Technique coaches bias growth vectors
- Conditioning coaches modify fatigue decay
- Medical staff reduce injury escalation

#### 4.2 Economy
- Staff salaries are fixed weekly drains
- Administrator reduces insolvency escalation
- Senior staff cost more, fail harder

#### 4.3 Governance
- Staff scandals increase scrutiny
- Medical negligence accelerates sanctions
- Assistant oyakata succession affects council decisions

#### 4.4 AI
NPC managers evaluate:
- staff burnout
- loyalty risk
- replacement cost
- succession readiness

---

## PART VI — STAFF SCANDALS

### 5. Staff-Originated Scandals

Examples:
- medical malpractice
- illegal training practices
- recruitment violations
- financial misreporting

Scandals attach to:
- staff member
- beya
- oyakata (derivative)

---

## PART VII — SUCCESSION & LEGACY

### 6. Assistant Oyakata Path

- Must hold or acquire kabu
- Reputation gated
- Loyalty-tested
- May defect to rival beya

Failure to plan succession increases closure probability.

---

## PART VIII — UI & NARRATIVE

### 7. Player Presentation

Staff are shown as:
- named individuals
- described by reputation and habits
- referenced in media and journals

No raw numbers.
No instant replacements.

---

## PART IX — FAILURE MODES (INTENTIONAL)

- Legendary coach retires mid-rebuild
- Doctor scandal collapses trust
- Loyal aide blocks necessary reform
- Costly staff inertia sinks finances

---

## PART X — CANON STATEMENT

> **Stables rise and fall on the people who run them — not just the wrestlers who fight.**


---

# PART IV — MEDICAL & WELFARE SYSTEM (NEW, EXPLICIT)

## 20. Medical Responsibility Chain

For every injury event, responsibility is assigned to:
- rikishi (behavioral overreach)
- staff (training load, treatment)
- facilities (quality limits)
- beya leadership (systemic neglect)

Responsibility determines escalation paths.

---

## 21. Welfare Risk Accumulation

WelfareRisk increases when:
- injuries occur under fatigue overload
- medical staff are understaffed
- recovery is rushed
- chronic injuries are ignored

WelfareRisk decays slowly only with sustained compliance.

---

## 22. Medical Liability States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Compliant | No active concern |
| Watch | Minor patterns detected |
| Investigation | Formal inquiry |
| Sanctioned | Penalties applied |
| Restricted | Forced changes |

These states are **public-facing**.

---

## 23. Deterministic Investigation Triggers

Triggered by:
- repeated similar injuries
- recovery below minimum curves
- whistleblower events (staff)
- media scrutiny

No random investigations.

---

# PART V — INJURY HANDLING (WIRED)

## 30. Injury Response Pipeline

1. Injury detected
2. Severity classified
3. Medical staff response selected
4. Recovery plan assigned
5. WelfareRisk updated
6. Governance exposure recalculated
7. Narrative record created

Every step is logged.

---

## 31. Negligence vs Misfortune

Negligence requires:
- deviation from required recovery protocol
- understaffed medical coverage
- pattern recurrence

Misfortune injuries do not escalate.

---

# PART VI — FACILITIES, STAFF & WELFARE INTERACTION

## 40. Facility Constraints

Low facility bands:
- increase injury severity
- slow recovery
- raise welfare scrutiny

High facility bands:
- cap injury escalation
- improve compliance reputation

---

## 41. Staff Burnout & Medical Error

Medical staff fatigue increases:
- misdiagnosis risk
- recovery delay
- scandal probability

Burnout is tracked and visible.

---

# PART VII — AI & PLAYER DECISIONS

## 50. AI Beya Management Logic

NPC managers evaluate:
- welfare risk trends
- staff burnout
- compliance danger
- replacement vs cost tradeoffs

AI will sacrifice short-term results to avoid sanctions.

---

## 51. Player Warnings & UI

Players see:
- “Medical oversight concerns”
- “Staff overextended”
- “Recovery protocols under review”

Never raw percentages.

---

# PART VIII — FAILURE MODES (INTENTIONAL)

- Star rikishi career shortened by neglect
- Beya sanctioned for pattern abuse
- Staff scapegoating vs systemic reform
- Financial collapse from compliance costs

---

# PART IX — SOURCE PRESERVATION ANNEX

## Beya Management v1.0
```md
# Stable Lords — Beya Management System v1.0 (Canonical, Training-Agnostic)

Date: 2026-01-06  
Status: Canonical, verbose, implementation-ready  
Scope: Defines **beya (stable) management** excluding training mechanics, which are specified in a separate document.

This document covers:
- roster structure and limits
- recruitment and intake
- staff and facilities (non-training effects)
- economics and solvency
- foreign wrestler rules (including dual citizenship)
- AI-controlled stable behavior
- failure modes and guardrails
- governance hooks (non-active)

---

## 1. Design Goals

Beya management must:
- Create **long-horizon strategic pressure**
- Force **trade-offs**, not micromanagement
- Remain **readable and narratively grounded**
- Apply equally to player-run and AI-run stables
- Integrate cleanly with:
  - rikishi evolution
  - combat outcomes
  - economy and prestige
  - future governance systems

> Managing a beya is about capacity, commitment, and risk — not per-bout control.

---

## 2. Beya as an Entity

Each beya is a persistent world object with:

- Identity (name, lineage, reputation)
- Physical capacity (roster, staff, facilities)
- Financial state (cash flow, upkeep)
- Recruitment pipeline
- Succession risk (forward-declared)

Beya decisions affect **all rikishi indirectly**.

---

## 3. Roster Management

### 3.1 Roster Size Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|---|---:|
| Minimum viable roster | 6 |
| Typical roster | 10–15 |
| Soft cap | 20 |
| Hard cap | 30 |

Below minimum:
- beya is flagged as *fragile*
- emergency recruitment or merger hooks appear

Above soft cap:
- diminishing returns and injury pressure (see §10)

Above hard cap:
- forbidden

---

### 3.2 Implicit Internal Structure

Rosters are not manually tiered. Structure emerges from:
- rank
- career phase
- focus allocation (defined elsewhere)

Implicit groups:
- Prospects
- Core competitors
- Stars
- Veterans

This structure feeds narrative, not control logic.

---

## 4. Recruitment & Intake

### 4.1 Recruitment Windows

Recruitment occurs only at:
1) **Post-basho review**
2) **Mid-interim (week 3)**

This limits spam and creates rhythm.

---

### 4.2 Recruitment Slots per Basho

Base: **1**

Modifiers:
- roster ≤ 12 → +1
- kitchen ≥ 3 AND dormitory ≥ 2 → +1
- roster ≥ 20 → −1

Result:
- min 0
- max 3 recruits per basho

---

### 4.3 Recruitment Sources (v1)

- Local prospects (baseline)
- Regional standouts (higher ceiling)
- Dual citizens (rare, special)
- Foreign recruits (slot-limited)

Transfers and academies are future extensions.

---

### 4.4 Recruitment Costs

| Recruit Type | Signing Cost |
|---|---:|
| Local prospect | ¥50,000 |
| Regional standout | ¥120,000 |

Recruitment immediately increases weekly upkeep.

---

## 5. Foreign Rikishi & Dual Citizenship

### 5.1 Canonical Rule

> **Each beya may roster at most ONE foreign-slot rikishi at any time.**

A rikishi consumes the foreign slot **only if they do not hold Japanese citizenship**.

---

### 5.2 Nationality Model

Each rikishi has:
- `birthCountry` (immutable)
- `citizenships[]`
- derived `foreignSlotStatus`

Foreign-slot if:
```
"Japan" NOT in citizenships[]
```

---

### 5.3 Dual Citizenship

- Dual citizens **do not** consume the foreign slot
- Dual citizenship is rare (≈5–10% of foreign-born recruits)
- Dual citizens still carry narrative and adaptation flavor

---

### 5.4 Recruitment Enforcement

- If foreign slot is occupied:
  - foreign-slot recruits do not appear
- Dual citizens may always appear
- UI must clearly show slot impact before signing

---

### 5.5 Future Naturalization (Dormant)

Naturalization is:
- rare
- prestige-gated
- narrative-significant

If activated, gaining Japanese citizenship frees the foreign slot.

---

## 6. Staff System (Non-Training Effects)

### 6.1 Staff Types

- Oyakata (always 1)
- Technique Coach
- Conditioning Coach
- Nutritionist
- Medical Staff

Training effects are defined elsewhere.  
Here, staff define **capacity, recovery, and mitigation**.

---

### 6.2 Staff Capacity

Each staff member has a coverage capacity:

| Staff | Capacity |
|---|---:|
| Technique Coach | 12 |
| Conditioning Coach | 12 |
| Nutritionist | 16 |
| Medical Staff | 18 |

If roster exceeds capacity:
```
effectiveStaffImpact = capacity / rosterSize
```

---

### 6.3 Staff Limits

- Max staff (excluding oyakata): **6**
- Max duplicates:
  - Technique: 2
  - Conditioning: 2
  - Nutrition: 1
  - Medical: 2 (optional elite scaling)

---

## 7. Facilities (Structural, Not Training)

Facilities define **ceilings and forgiveness**, not skill choices.

| Facility | Effect |
|---|---|
| Dojo | Technique ceiling |
| Kitchen | Weight control stability |
| Recovery | Fatigue decay |
| Medical | Injury severity & recurrence |
| Dormitory | Morale & baseline recovery |

Facility levels: 0–5 each.

---

### 7.1 Facility Costs

**Build / Upgrade (one-time):**

| Level | Cost |
|---|---:|
| 1 | ¥150,000 |
| 2 | ¥250,000 |
| 3 | ¥400,000 |
| 4 | ¥600,000 |
| 5 | ¥900,000 |

**Weekly upkeep:**
```
¥1,000 × total facility levels
```

---

## 8. Beya Economics

### 8.1 Weekly Expenses

| Expense | Formula |
|---|---|
| Wrestlers | ¥2,000 × roster size |
| Staff | ¥6,000 × staff count |
| Facilities | ¥1,000 × facility levels |

Expenses are continuous and unavoidable.

---

### 8.2 Income (High-Level)

- Kenshō banners
- Prestige-modified appearance value
- Success-driven visibility

Income volatility is intentional.

---

### 8.3 Insolvency Handling

- Grace period (weeks)
- Forced austerity (freeze recruitment, sell facilities)
- Later: loans / benefactors (dormant)

---

## 9. AI-Run Stables

AI stables obey **exactly the same rules**.

### 9.1 AI Management Profiles

| Profile | Identity |
|---|---|
| Talent Factory | Large pipeline, conservative |
| Star Chaser | Small elite, aggressive |
| Survivor | Risk-averse |
| Gambler | High variance |
| Traditionalist | Identity-driven |

---

### 9.2 AI Weekly Decision Loop

Each interim week:
1) Check solvency runway
2) Check injury burden
3) Check roster vs target
4) Allocate focus (defined elsewhere)
5) Consider facility upgrades
6) Evaluate recruitment windows

Decisions are deterministic but imperfect.

---

### 9.3 AI Foreign Rikishi Logic

AI evaluates:
- foreign slot availability
- injury risk tolerance
- facilities readiness
- profile risk bias

AI is reluctant to release foreign-slot rikishi unless forced.

---

## 10. Failure Modes & Guardrails

### 10.1 Overcrowding
- Training efficiency loss
- Injury pressure
- Staff dilution

### 10.2 Star Hoarding
- Succession risk
- Injury fragility
- Financial volatility

### 10.3 Insolvency
- Gradual collapse, not instant death

### 10.4 Succession Collapse (Future)
- No eligible successor → closure or merger

Failure is allowed and narratively valuable.

---

## 11. Governance Hooks (Dormant)

Even before activation:
- beya legitimacy tracked
- conduct and solvency logged
- succession candidates evaluated

Later governance systems plug into these signals without retcons.

---

## 12. UI & Player Communication Rules

- Always show:
  - roster size vs caps
  - foreign slot usage
  - weekly burn rate
- Never show:
  - raw hidden efficiency math
- Explain consequences in plain language

---

## 13. Canon One-Liner

> **A beya is not a menu of buffs — it is a living institution whose size, staff, finances, and commitments determine which careers flourish and which fail.**

# Stable Lords — Rikishi Development Canon v1.1
## Ultra-Granular Training + Evolution Constitution (Implementation Grade)

Status: **DEFINITIVE**
Scope: **Only rikishi development over time**
Explicitly excludes: combat resolution, economy amounts, roster admin

This document is:
- larger than its source material
- non-lossy
- explicit down to weekly ticks and state transitions
- suitable for direct engineering implementation

It consolidates and EXPANDS:
- Training System v1.0
- Rikishi Evolution System v1.0

---

# PART I — ABSOLUTE DESIGN LAWS (DEVELOPMENT SCOPE)

## 1. Determinism
All development outcomes are a pure function of:
- WorldSeed
- RikishiSeed
- TimeIndex (week)
- Training profile selections
- Injury history
- Career phase

No runtime RNG.
No “soft” decay.

## 2. Separation of Timescales
- **Training** operates weekly
- **Evolution** accumulates monthly and basho-end
- **Career phase** shifts are rare and thresholded

This separation prevents oscillation.

---

# PART II — RIKISHI STATE MODEL (NORMALIZED)

# PART III — TRAINING SYSTEM (EXPANDED + WIRED)

# Stable Lords — Training System v1.0 (Canonical)

Date: 2026-01-06  
Status: Canonical, verbose, implementation-ready  
Scope: Defines **training mechanics** at both beya and individual levels, and how training shapes rikishi evolution.  
This document intentionally excludes roster management, economics, and AI manager logic, which are defined elsewhere.

---

## 1. Design Goals

The training system must:
- Provide **meaningful player agency** without micromanagement
- Shape long-term **rikishi evolution**, not short-term bout outcomes
- Create **risk–reward trade-offs**
- Be **deterministic and legible**
- Integrate cleanly with:
  - Rikishi Evolution System
  - Beya Management System
  - NPC Manager AI System

> Training biases probability; it never guarantees greatness.

---

## 2. Core Training Philosophy

Training operates on **bias and pressure**, not direct stat control.

Players and AI:
- do not assign drills or skills directly
- choose **intensity, focus, and protection**
- accept downstream consequences via fatigue, injuries, and style drift

Training is evaluated **weekly** during interim periods.

---

## 3. Training Layers

Training exists on three stacked layers:

1. **Beya-Wide Training Profile** (default environment)
2. **Individual Focus Slots** (limited overrides)
3. **Facilities & Staff Modifiers** (multipliers, not decisions)

This ensures:
- consistency
- scarcity of attention
- emergent specialization

---

## 4. Beya-Wide Training Profile

Each beya selects one active training profile per interim.

### 4.1 Training Axes

Training profile is defined by four axes:

#### A) Intensity
- Conservative
- Balanced
- Intensive
- Punishing

#### B) Focus Bias
- Power
- Speed
- Technique
- Balance
- Neutral

#### C) Style Bias
- Oshi
- Yotsu
- Neutral

#### D) Recovery Emphasis
- Low
- Normal
- High

These axes modify growth, fatigue, and injury risk.

---

### 4.2 Default Numeric Effects (Illustrative)

#### Intensity Effects

| Intensity | Growth Mult | Fatigue Gain | Injury Risk |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 0.85 | 0.75 | 0.80 |
| Balanced | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Intensive | 1.20 | 1.25 | 1.15 |
| Punishing | 1.35 | 1.50 | 1.35 |

#### Recovery Emphasis Effects

| Recovery | Fatigue Decay | Injury Recovery |
|---|---:|---:|
| Low | 0.80 | 0.85 |
| Normal | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| High | 1.25 | 1.20 |

---

### 4.3 Focus Bias → Skill Growth Bias

| Focus | Power | Speed | Technique | Balance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Power | 1.30 | 0.85 | 0.95 | 0.95 |
| Speed | 0.85 | 1.30 | 0.95 | 0.95 |
| Technique | 0.90 | 0.90 | 1.35 | 1.10 |
| Balance | 0.90 | 0.95 | 1.10 | 1.35 |
| Neutral | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |

---

## 5. Individual Focus Slots

### 5.1 Focus Slot Availability
- Base slots: **3**
- +1 at prestige tier 2
- +1 at prestige tier 4
- Max: **5**

Only focused rikishi may receive individual overrides.

---

### 5.2 Focus Modes

Each focus slot selects one mode:

| Mode | Growth | Fatigue | Injury Risk | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Develop | +25% | +10% | +5% | Default growth |
| Push | +35% | +20% | +20% | Win-now pressure |
| Protect | −15% | −25% | −30% | Longevity |
| Rebuild | +10% | −10% | −15% | Post-injury |

Focus modes stack multiplicatively with beya-wide profile.

---

## 6. Training → Rikishi Evolution Wiring

### 6.1 Physique
- High intensity → faster weight gain
- High recovery → controlled weight, better fulfillment
- Overtraining → stalled growth + injury spikes

Height is unaffected after youth.

---

### 6.2 Skills
Training biases **effectiveness growth**, not raw skill caps.

Growth is:
- fast early
- diminishing in prime
- fragile in veteran phase

---

### 6.3 Style Drift
Training does not set style directly.

Instead:
- Style bias nudges recomputation thresholds
- Sustained mismatch between body and training causes inefficiency

This prevents “click to choose style” exploits.

---

### 6.4 Archetype Interaction
Training does **not** change dominant archetype.

It may:
- accelerate secondary archetype emergence
- suppress risky behaviors under conservative regimes

---

## 7. Fatigue & Injury Integration

### 7.1 Fatigue
- Accumulates weekly from training
- Scales with intensity and focus
- Decays via recovery emphasis and facilities

High fatigue:
- reduces bout performance
- increases injury risk
- pushes kimarite selection toward short finishes

---

### 7.2 Injuries
Training contributes to injury probability.

Risk factors:
- high fatigue
- punishing intensity
- low recovery
- prior injury history

Injuries apply:
- attribute penalties
- recovery timelines
- narrative hooks

---

## 8. Career Phase Sensitivity

Training effectiveness varies by phase:

| Phase | Growth | Injury Sensitivity |
|---|---:|---:|
| Youth | High | Low |
| Development | High | Medium |
| Prime | Medium | Medium |
| Veteran | Low | High |
| Late | Very Low | Very High |

This encourages different strategies across careers.

---

## 9. AI Use of Training

AI managers select training profiles based on:
- their profile traits
- roster composition
- injury load
- meta drift signals
- financial runway

Examples:
- Survivor favors Conservative + High Recovery
- Gambler spikes Punishing during contention
- Talent Factory uses Balanced + Neutral

AI obeys same focus slot limits as player.

---

## 10. Player UX Rules

Players see:
- training philosophy descriptions
- warnings (“Injury risk rising”)
- trend indicators (“Style drifting toward Yotsu”)

Players never see:
- raw multipliers
- hidden fatigue math

---

## 11. Failure Modes (By Design)

- Overtraining cascades
- Burned-out prospects
- Injury-plagued stars
- Short primes with spectacular peaks

These are outcomes, not bugs.

# PART IV — EVOLUTION SYSTEM (EXPANDED + WIRED)

# Stable Lords — Rikishi Evolution System v1.0 (Canonical)

Date: 2026-01-06  
Scope: Full, end-to-end specification of **rikishi evolution** in Stable Lords, covering physique, skills, style, archetype, kimarite identity, and career arcs.  
Status: Canonical, deterministic, implementation-ready.

This document explains **how a rikishi changes over time**, why those changes occur, and how they connect to combat, narrative, and UI.

---

## 1. Design Goals

Rikishi evolution must:
- Be **deterministic** and reproducible.
- Produce **believable career arcs** without scripted outcomes.
- Be **readable to players** (no hidden “RPG decay”).
- Integrate cleanly with:
  - Combat Engine V3
  - Kimarite tier/style/archetype system
  - Rivalries and narrative
  - Career journals and governance

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **Rikishi do not gain or lose abstract “power.”  
They change bodies, habits, and constraints — and the simulation responds.**

Evolution is the interaction of:
1. Physique (body)
2. Skills (execution)
3. Style (technical preference)
4. Archetype (temperament)
5. Kimarite identity (proof of behavior)
6. Career phase (time + pressure)

Each layer evolves on a different timescale.

---

## 3. Data Model Overview

### 3.1 Permanent Identity (Never Changes)
- `id`
- `shikona`
- origin metadata
- base talent seed
- growth profile seed
- dominant archetype (initial)

These define *who the rikishi is*.

### 3.2 Evolving State (Changes Over Time)
- heightCurrent / weightCurrent
- growth fulfillment
- skill outputs (power, speed, balance, technique, experience)
- fatigue, injuries, momentum
- style (oshi / yotsu / hybrid)
- secondary archetype tendency (optional)
- favored kimarite (tokui-waza)
- career phase

---

## 4. Physique Evolution (The Body Layer)

### 4.1 Height
- Grows early career only.
- Stops deterministically based on growth profile.
- Influences reach, leverage, grip geometry.

Height explains *structural possibility*, not tactical choice.

### 4.2 Weight (Primary Evolution Lever)
- Changes throughout career.
- Influences:
  - power effectiveness
  - speed effectiveness
  - fatigue accumulation
  - injury risk
  - recovery rate
- Strongest driver of style drift.

### 4.3 Current vs Potential
Each rikishi has:
- `heightPotentialCm`
- `weightPotentialKg`
- `growthFulfillment` ∈ [0,1]

Potential is a **ceiling**, not a guarantee.
Training, injuries, and facilities determine how close it is reached.

---

## 5. Skill Evolution (Execution Layer)

Canonical skill outputs:
- **Power** — force generation and drive
- **Speed** — burst and lateral movement
- **Balance** — resistance to displacement and counters
- **Technique** — grip craft, throw timing, transitions
- **Experience** — decision quality and counters

### 5.1 Growth Pattern
- Youth: spiky, uneven gains
- Development: steady improvement
- Prime: diminishing returns
- Veteran: flat or declining effectiveness
- Late: managed decline

Skills are modified by physique:
- Same technique score behaves differently at different weights.

---

## 6. Style Evolution (Primary Public Identity)

Styles:
- **Oshi** — distance, push/thrust
- **Yotsu** — belt, control, throws
- **Hybrid** — adaptable

### 6.1 Style Is Derived
Style is recomputed periodically from:
- weight trends
- balance vs speed ratio
- grip success rates
- kimarite usage distribution
- career phase bias

### 6.2 Hysteresis
- Style changes require sustained signals.
- Prevents oscillation basho-to-basho.

Style is **what the rikishi usually tries to do**.

---

## 7. Archetype Evolution (Temperament Layer)

Archetypes describe **behavior under pressure**.

### 7.1 Dominant Archetype
- Seeded at creation.
- Rarely changes.
- Represents temperament.

### 7.2 Secondary Archetype Drift
- Optional, slow-moving.
- Emerges from repeated behavior patterns.
- Strength ∈ [0.1–0.5].

Dominant archetype applies fully.  
Secondary archetype bends behavior slightly.

---

## 8. Kimarite Identity (Proof of Evolution)

### 8.1 Favored Kimarite (Tokui-waza)
- Tracked from actual wins.
- Top 2–3 maintained.
- Applies 2× selection bonus in combat.

### 8.2 Feedback Loop
Body → Style → Kimarite usage → Favorites → Reinforcement

As the body changes, favored moves may fade or be replaced.

---

## 9. Career Phases (Arc Layer)

Phases are computed, not age-locked:
1. Youth / Prospect
2. Development / Rise
3. Prime
4. Veteran / Decline
5. Late Career / Exit

Inputs:
- age
- growth fulfillment plateau
- injury accumulation
- fatigue recovery slowdown
- performance trends

Phases bias:
- growth rates
- injury risk
- style drift likelihood
- retirement triggers

---

## 10. Determinism Contract

Every evolution step is derived from:
- World seed
- Rikishi seed
- Time index
- Player inputs (training, facilities)
- Deterministic outcomes (bouts, injuries)

No hidden randomness.  
Same inputs → same careers.

---

## 11. UI & Readability Rules

### 11.1 Rikishi Card
- **Style**: primary label
- **Archetype**: secondary
- **Secondary archetype**: only if meaningful
- **Favored kimarite**: visible proof
- Physique shown indirectly via notes, not raw stats by default

### 11.2 Advanced Views
- Physique history
- Style drift timeline
- Kimarite usage charts
- Career journal entries

---

## 12. Narrative Integration

Narrative systems consume evolution:
- “Former speedster adapts to belt fighting”
- “Signature throw fades after knee injury”
- “Late-career reinvention”

Narrative never changes outcomes.

---

## 13. Why This Works

- Careers feel authored, but are not scripted.
- Decline feels earned, not punitive.
- Specialization emerges organically.
- Players learn to *read* wrestlers, not stats.

---

## 14. Canon One-Liner

> **Rikishi evolution is the story of a body adapting to time, pressure, and consequence — expressed through style, behavior, and the techniques that survive.**

# PART V — TRAINING → EVOLUTION WIRING (NEW, GRANULAR)

## 15. Weekly Tick Algorithm (Explicit)

For each rikishi, each week:

1. Read beya training profile
2. Read individual focus (if any)
3. Compute growthBiasVector
4. Compute fatigueDelta
5. Compute injuryRiskDelta
6. Apply fatigue accumulation
7. Roll deterministic injury check
8. Apply injury state transitions
9. Accumulate growth progress (buffered)
10. Log DevelopmentEvent

No evolution is applied immediately to combat outputs until monthly consolidation.

---

## 16. Monthly Consolidation

Every 4 weeks:
- buffered growth applies to physique and skills
- style recomputation check runs
- favored kimarite may update
- career phase transition check runs

---

## 17. Career Phase Transition Rules (Explicit)

Transitions require **multiple signals**:
- growthFulfillment plateau
- fatigue recovery slowdown
- injury frequency
- performance trend

Single signals never force a phase change.

---

# PART VI — FAILURE MODES (INTENTIONAL)

- Burned prospects
- Late bloomers
- Short primes
- Reinvention arcs
- Chronic injury decline

These outcomes are authored by systems, not random chance.

---

# PART VII — UI CONTRACT (DEVELOPMENT)

Players see:
- philosophy language
- warnings
- trend descriptors

Players never see:
- growth buffers
- raw multipliers
- phase thresholds

---

# PART VIII — SOURCE PRESERVATION ANNEX (VERBATIM)

## Training System v1.0
```md
# Stable Lords — Training System v1.0 (Canonical)

Date: 2026-01-06  
Status: Canonical, verbose, implementation-ready  
Scope: Defines **training mechanics** at both beya and individual levels, and how training shapes rikishi evolution.  
This document intentionally excludes roster management, economics, and AI manager logic, which are defined elsewhere.

---

## 1. Design Goals

The training system must:
- Provide **meaningful player agency** without micromanagement
- Shape long-term **rikishi evolution**, not short-term bout outcomes
- Create **risk–reward trade-offs**
- Be **deterministic and legible**
- Integrate cleanly with:
  - Rikishi Evolution System
  - Beya Management System
  - NPC Manager AI System

> Training biases probability; it never guarantees greatness.

---

## 2. Core Training Philosophy

Training operates on **bias and pressure**, not direct stat control.

Players and AI:
- do not assign drills or skills directly
- choose **intensity, focus, and protection**
- accept downstream consequences via fatigue, injuries, and style drift

Training is evaluated **weekly** during interim periods.

---

## 3. Training Layers

Training exists on three stacked layers:

1. **Beya-Wide Training Profile** (default environment)
2. **Individual Focus Slots** (limited overrides)
3. **Facilities & Staff Modifiers** (multipliers, not decisions)

This ensures:
- consistency
- scarcity of attention
- emergent specialization

---

## 4. Beya-Wide Training Profile

Each beya selects one active training profile per interim.

### 4.1 Training Axes

Training profile is defined by four axes:

#### A) Intensity
- Conservative
- Balanced
- Intensive
- Punishing

#### B) Focus Bias
- Power
- Speed
- Technique
- Balance
- Neutral

#### C) Style Bias
- Oshi
- Yotsu
- Neutral

#### D) Recovery Emphasis
- Low
- Normal
- High

These axes modify growth, fatigue, and injury risk.

---

### 4.2 Default Numeric Effects (Illustrative)

#### Intensity Effects

| Intensity | Growth Mult | Fatigue Gain | Injury Risk |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 0.85 | 0.75 | 0.80 |
| Balanced | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Intensive | 1.20 | 1.25 | 1.15 |
| Punishing | 1.35 | 1.50 | 1.35 |

#### Recovery Emphasis Effects

| Recovery | Fatigue Decay | Injury Recovery |
|---|---:|---:|
| Low | 0.80 | 0.85 |
| Normal | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| High | 1.25 | 1.20 |

---

### 4.3 Focus Bias → Skill Growth Bias

| Focus | Power | Speed | Technique | Balance |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Power | 1.30 | 0.85 | 0.95 | 0.95 |
| Speed | 0.85 | 1.30 | 0.95 | 0.95 |
| Technique | 0.90 | 0.90 | 1.35 | 1.10 |
| Balance | 0.90 | 0.95 | 1.10 | 1.35 |
| Neutral | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |

---

## 5. Individual Focus Slots

### 5.1 Focus Slot Availability
- Base slots: **3**
- +1 at prestige tier 2
- +1 at prestige tier 4
- Max: **5**

Only focused rikishi may receive individual overrides.

---

### 5.2 Focus Modes

Each focus slot selects one mode:

| Mode | Growth | Fatigue | Injury Risk | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Develop | +25% | +10% | +5% | Default growth |
| Push | +35% | +20% | +20% | Win-now pressure |
| Protect | −15% | −25% | −30% | Longevity |
| Rebuild | +10% | −10% | −15% | Post-injury |

Focus modes stack multiplicatively with beya-wide profile.

---

## 6. Training → Rikishi Evolution Wiring

### 6.1 Physique
- High intensity → faster weight gain
- High recovery → controlled weight, better fulfillment
- Overtraining → stalled growth + injury spikes

Height is unaffected after youth.

---

### 6.2 Skills
Training biases **effectiveness growth**, not raw skill caps.

Growth is:
- fast early
- diminishing in prime
- fragile in veteran phase

---

### 6.3 Style Drift
Training does not set style directly.

Instead:
- Style bias nudges recomputation thresholds
- Sustained mismatch between body and training causes inefficiency

This prevents “click to choose style” exploits.

---

### 6.4 Archetype Interaction
Training does **not** change dominant archetype.

It may:
- accelerate secondary archetype emergence
- suppress risky behaviors under conservative regimes

---

## 7. Fatigue & Injury Integration

### 7.1 Fatigue
- Accumulates weekly from training
- Scales with intensity and focus
- Decays via recovery emphasis and facilities

High fatigue:
- reduces bout performance
- increases injury risk
- pushes kimarite selection toward short finishes

---

### 7.2 Injuries
Training contributes to injury probability.

Risk factors:
- high fatigue
- punishing intensity
- low recovery
- prior injury history

Injuries apply:
- attribute penalties
- recovery timelines
- narrative hooks

---

## 8. Career Phase Sensitivity

Training effectiveness varies by phase:

| Phase | Growth | Injury Sensitivity |
|---|---:|---:|
| Youth | High | Low |
| Development | High | Medium |
| Prime | Medium | Medium |
| Veteran | Low | High |
| Late | Very Low | Very High |

This encourages different strategies across careers.

---

## 9. AI Use of Training

AI managers select training profiles based on:
- their profile traits
- roster composition
- injury load
- meta drift signals
- financial runway

Examples:
- Survivor favors Conservative + High Recovery
- Gambler spikes Punishing during contention
- Talent Factory uses Balanced + Neutral

AI obeys same focus slot limits as player.

---

## 10. Player UX Rules

Players see:
- training philosophy descriptions
- warnings (“Injury risk rising”)
- trend indicators (“Style drifting toward Yotsu”)

Players never see:
- raw multipliers
- hidden fatigue math

---

## 11. Failure Modes (By Design)

- Overtraining cascades
- Burned-out prospects
- Injury-plagued stars
- Short primes with spectacular peaks

These are outcomes, not bugs.

# PART IX — INJURY STATE MACHINE (EXPLICIT)

## 30. Injury States

Each rikishi maintains exactly one InjuryState:

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| Healthy | No active injury |
| Minor | Short-term strain |
| Moderate | Noticeable impairment |
| Severe | Long-term impairment |
| Chronic | Persistent recurring condition |
| CareerEnding | Forced retirement trigger |

## 31. Injury Severity Thresholds

Severity is determined by:
- fatigue band
- physique stress ratio
- bout intensity band
- accumulated micro-injury count

No random rolls; thresholds are deterministic.

## 32. Recovery Curves

Each state defines:
- minimum recovery weeks
- performance penalty band
- re-injury amplification factor

Chronic injuries permanently reduce recovery efficiency.

---

# PART X — STYLE DRIFT & RECLASSIFICATION

## 33. Style Confidence Model

Each style label maintains a confidence score:
- oshi
- yotsu
- hybrid

Scores update monthly using:
- kimarite usage distribution
- grip success ratios
- physique suitability

## 34. Drift Thresholds

Style changes only when:
- new style confidence > old style by X margin
- sustained for ≥2 basho
- not blocked by injury limitations

Abrupt style flips are impossible.

---

## 35. Favored Kimarite Evolution

Favored kimarite list updates when:
- same kimarite used ≥N times
- above-average success rate
- fits current style

Favorites decay if unused for extended periods.

---

# PART XI — WORKED EXAMPLE (10-YEAR CAREER)

## 36. Rikishi Example: “Kazanoumi”

### Year 1–2 (Prospect)
- rapid weight gain
- minor injuries
- style confidence unclear

### Year 3–5 (Rise)
- oshi style locks in
- favored kimarite: oshidashi, tsukidashi
- first makuuchi promotion

### Year 6–7 (Prime)
- peak power output
- rare injury-free stretch
- sansho awards

### Year 8–9 (Decline)
- chronic knee injury
- style drifts toward defensive yotsu
- fewer favored techniques

### Year 10 (Exit)
- chronic state escalates
- retirement eligibility triggered
- legacy logged

Every step corresponds to weekly and monthly ticks.

---

# PART XII — ADDITIONAL FAILURE & EDGE CASES

- Sudden injury-caused plateau
- Style-lock preventing adaptation
- Late-blooming technique specialists
- Premature burnout via overtraining

All are deterministic outcomes.

---

# PART XIII — EXTENDED SOURCE PRESERVATION

This document preserves **all v1.1 content verbatim**, plus expanded systems.
No earlier rules are removed or weakened.

---

END OF Rikishi Development Canon v1.2


---

# PART XIV — MENTAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL LOAD SYSTEM

## 40. Mental State Model

Each rikishi maintains a **MentalState** vector, separate from physical fatigue:

| Dimension | Description |
|---|---|
| Confidence | Belief in own execution |
| Pressure | External expectation weight |
| Fear | Hesitation under risk |
| Focus | Consistency of decision-making |
| Resilience | Recovery from setbacks |

MentalState values are internal scalars; players see **narrative descriptors only**.

---

## 41. Mental State Inputs (Deterministic)

Mental updates occur weekly and post-bout:

- Win/Loss streaks
- Upsets (positive or negative)
- Rivalry bouts
- Media tone
- Stable stature pressure
- Career phase

No random swings are permitted.

---

## 42. Mental → Performance Mapping

Mental states affect:
- initiative bands
- error likelihood bands
- comeback probability bands
- injury escalation risk

These effects are capped to prevent total collapse.

---

## 43. Psychological Failure Modes

- Confidence spiral (loss streaks)
- Fear lock (post-injury hesitation)
- Pressure collapse (elite expectations)
- Veteran composure advantage

These are system-authored outcomes.

---

# PART XV — TRAINING FACILITIES & STAFF MICRO-EFFECTS

## 50. Facility Bands

Facilities are modeled in qualitative bands:

| Band | Description |
|---|---|
| Primitive | Minimal, outdated |
| Basic | Functional |
| Adequate | Competitive |
| Advanced | Modern, specialized |
| Elite | Cutting-edge |

Facilities modify:
- training efficiency
- injury risk
- recovery speed
- mental fatigue

---

## 51. Staff Roles

Each stable may have:
- Head Coach
- Conditioning Coach
- Medical Staff
- Mental Coach (rare)

Each role provides:
- bias modifiers
- risk dampening
- specialization bonuses

---

## 52. Facility × Training Interaction

Training outputs are multiplied by:
- facility band modifier
- staff competency modifier

Modifiers are deterministic and logged.

---

# PART XVI — RETIREMENT, POST-CAREER & LEGACY

## 60. Retirement Eligibility

Triggered by:
- age thresholds
- chronic injury state
- sustained decline
- governance events

Retirement is optional unless forced.

---

## 61. Retirement Outcomes

Possible paths:
- Stable staff role
- Independent coach
- Oyakata candidate
- Exit from sumo world

Each path affects:
- legacy score
- institutional memory
- future NPC behavior

---

## 62. Legacy Scoring (Narrative)

Legacy is computed from:
- peak rank
- career longevity
- rivalries
- championships
- scandals

Legacy affects:
- how the rikishi is referenced in history
- eligibility for honors
- successor narratives

---

## 63. Post-Career Persistence

Retired rikishi remain:
- in historical records
- as NPCs (if relevant)
- as reference points in commentary

No character is deleted from history.

---

# PART XVII — FULL DEVELOPMENT FLOW SUMMARY

Weekly:
- Training
- Mental update
- Fatigue/injury check

Monthly:
- Evolution consolidation
- Style drift check
- Favored kimarite update

Basho-End:
- Career phase review
- Mental pressure recalibration
- Retirement eligibility check

```
# Stable Lords — Banzuke, Scheduling & Awards System v1.3  
## Full-Detail Canonical Specification

Date: 2026-01-06  
Status: Canonical, deterministic, implementation-grade  
Supersedes:
- Banzuke & Scheduling System v1.0
- Banzuke, Scheduling & Basho Awards System v1.1
- Banzuke, Scheduling & Awards System v1.2 (summary)

This document restores **full mechanical and heuristic detail** while retaining all award logic and integrations introduced in later versions. It is the **authoritative contract** for ranking, matchmaking, promotion, playoffs, and basho honors.

---

## 1. System Role & Design Philosophy

The Banzuke system is the **legitimacy engine** of Stable Lords.

It:
- converts bout outcomes into social hierarchy
- defines economic thresholds (sekitori status)
- shapes AI planning horizons
- anchors narrative memory and prestige
- constrains governance decisions

> The banzuke is not a leaderboard — it is an institutional judgment rendered in public.

Design requirements:
- fully deterministic
- explainable after the fact
- resistant to edge-case abuse
- recognizable to sumo-literate players

## 2. Divisional Structure

### 2.1 Divisions, Sizes & Bout Counts

| Division | Abbrev | Target Size | Bouts |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Makuuchi | M | 42 | 15 |
| Jūryō | J | 28 | 15 |
| Makushita | Ms | ~120 | 7 |
| Sandanme | Sd | ~200 | 7 |
| Jonidan | Jd | ~350 | 7 |
| Jonokuchi | Jk | ~100 | 7 |

Rules:
- Makuuchi and Jūryō are **hard-capped**
- Lower divisions may flex temporarily to absorb overflow
- All overflow is resolved by next basho

---

## 3. Rank Encoding & Ordering

### 3.1 Canonical Rank ID

```
{Division}{Number}{Side}
Examples: M3E, J14W, Ms2, S1E
```

Rules:
- East always outranks West at same number
- Lower numbers outrank higher
- Yokozuna and Ōzeki retain internal ordering even if side-hidden

### 3.2 Rank Object (Engine Contract)

```ts
Rank {
  division: DivisionID
  number: number
  side?: "E" | "W"
  orderIndex: number
}
```

---

## 4. Basho Structure

- 6 basho per year
- 15 days per basho
- One bout per day for sekitori
- Lower divisions fight on scheduled subset days
- All bouts emit:
  - result
  - kimarite
  - duration
  - fatigue delta
  - narrative hooks

---

## 5. Torikumi (Matchmaking)

### 5.1 Core Principles

Torikumi prioritizes **legitimacy over fairness**.

Constraints:
- no repeat opponents within a basho
- stablemates never fight (except playoff edge cases)
- injuries and withdrawals respected

Priority signals:
1. Rank proximity
2. Record similarity
3. Yūshō impact
4. Rivalries
5. East/West balance

---

### 5.2 Upper Division Scheduling Phases

**Days 1–5 (Opening):**
- Rank bands ±2
- Conservative pairing
- Yokozuna protected from early clashes

**Days 6–10 (Sorting):**
- Record-based matching
- Leaders face resistance
- Rank distance allowed to widen

**Days 11–14 (Contention):**
- Direct yūshō impact prioritized
- Leaders face leaders
- Narrative stakes peak

**Day 15 (Resolution):**
- Highest-impact bouts only
- Playoff preparation

---

### 5.3 Lower Division Scheduling

- Fixed bout counts (usually 7)
- Drawn from same division bands
- Fewer rematch constraints
- Emphasis on promotion sorting

---

## 6. Promotion & Demotion Logic

### 6.1 Core Inputs

For each rikishi:
- starting rank
- wins / losses
- opponent average rank
- division slot pressure

No randomness.

---

### 6.2 Upper Division Heuristics

**Jūryō ↔ Makuuchi**
- 8–7 at M17 → borderline
- 7–8 at M16–17 → demotion candidate
- 9–6 at J1–J2 → promotion candidate
- Excess resolved by:
  1. wins
  2. opponent strength
  3. prior rank

**Sanyaku**
- Komusubi / Sekiwake: 8+ wins to retain
- Ōzeki:
  - make-koshi → kadoban
  - two consecutive make-koshi → demotion
  - promotion via ~33 wins over 3 basho
- Yokozuna:
  - promotion requires yūshō-level dominance
  - never demoted, only retired (governance hook)

---

### 6.3 Lower Division Promotion

- Promotion bands by wins
- High Makushita promotion strictly limited by Jūryō slots
- Overflow absorbed downward temporarily

---

## 7. Rank Reassignment Algorithm

1. Partition by division
2. Sort by:
   - wins
   - opponent strength
   - prior rank
3. Assign slots top-down
4. Alternate East/West
5. Resolve conflicts deterministically

Produces identical banzuke given identical inputs.

---

## 8. Playoffs

### 8.1 Yūshō Ties

- Triggered by shared best record
- Single-elimination
- Order determined by:
  1. head-to-head
  2. rank
  3. seeded shuffle

Fatigue carries over.

---

## 9. Basho Awards & Sanshō

### 9.1 Emperor’s Cup (Yūshō)

- Awarded to basho champion
- Major prestige anchor
- Strong promotion signal
- Historical milestone

---

### 9.2 Sanshō Eligibility

- Maegashira and below
- Minimum 8 wins
- Not withdrawn

---

### 9.3 Fighting Spirit (Kantō-shō)

Signals:
- upset wins
- high-intensity bouts
- exceeding rank expectation

Deterministic score model applied.

---

### 9.4 Technique (Ginō-shō)

Signals:
- kimarite variety
- uncommon / rare techniques
- clean execution

Uses Kimarite Tier System.

---

### 9.5 Outstanding Performance (Shukun-shō)

Signals:
- Yokozuna defeat
- decisive yūshō impact
- landmark achievements

---

### 9.6 Multiple Sanshō

Allowed but rare.
Narratively emphasized.

---

## 10. Additional Trophies

- Prime Minister’s Cup
- JSA Cup
- MacArthur Cup (foreign-born yūshō)
- Technique Excellence Trophy
- Fighting Spirit Trophy (analytics-visible)

---

## 11. Award Resolution Order

1. Resolve playoffs
2. Lock records
3. Compute scores
4. Validate eligibility
5. Emit awards

Awards never retroactively affect rank.

---

## 12. Data Output Contracts

### 12.1 RankSnapshot

```ts
RankSnapshot {
  rikishiId
  division
  rank
  number
  side
  bashoId
}
```

### 12.2 BashoResult

```ts
BashoResult {
  rikishiId
  wins
  losses
  startRank
  endRank
  awards[]
}
```

---

## 13. Integration Hooks

- **Economy:** sekitori salary thresholds, prestige
- **AI:** promotion planning, risk appetite
- **Narrative:** collapse arcs, miracle runs
- **Governance:** yokozuna approval, sanctions

---

## 14. Determinism Guarantee

Same inputs → same:
- torikumi
- banzuke
- promotions
- awards

No hidden randomness.

---

## 15. Canon One-Liner

> The banzuke is the public memory of sumo — everything else exists to justify it.

### PBP System v3.2
```
# Stable Lords — Sumo Play‑by‑Play (PBP) System v3.2  
## Ultimate Definitive Canon: Narrative, Ritual, Memory, Variety & Commerce

Date: 2026‑01‑06  
Status: **ULTIMATE DEFINITIVE CANON — FULL DETAIL, NON‑HIGH‑LEVEL**  
Supersedes:
- PBP v1.0
- PBP v1.1
- PBP v1.2
- PBP v1.3
- PBP v2.0
- PBP v2.1
- PBP v2.3
- PBP v3.0
- PBP v3.1

This document **fully and explicitly consolidates every PBP system feature, rule, constraint, and design ideal** defined across all prior Stable Lords PBP documents.

Nothing is summarized.
Nothing is implied.
Nothing is deferred.

If a question concerns **how a bout is presented, narrated, ritualized, remembered, or described**, this document governs.

---

## 1. System Authority & Role

The PBP system is the **sole narrative presentation authority** for sumo bouts.

It:
- renders deterministic Combat Engine V3 outcomes into cultural experience
- preserves sumo ritual, restraint, and institutional gravity
- creates long‑term memory through language
- teaches sumo implicitly without exposing mechanics

The PBP system **never influences**:
- bout outcomes
- AI decisions
- economy calculations
- governance logic

> The engine decides the bout.  
> The hall remembers it.  
> PBP gives it voice.

---

## 2. Binding Constraints (Hard Rules)

### 2.1 Narrative‑Only Surface
PBP output must NEVER:
- display numbers
- reference probabilities or rarity
- expose stats, tiers, weights, or ratings
- describe internal engine phases
- imply alternate outcomes

### 2.2 Determinism Contract
Given identical:
- world seed
- bout state
- venue
- crowd memory
- sponsor state
- phrase history

The generated PBP text **must be identical**.

No RNG prose.  
No stochastic applause.  
No drifting tone.

---

## 3. Narrative Flow Architecture

### 3.1 Continuous Flow Rule
A bout is rendered as **one uninterrupted narrative passage**.

The player never sees:
- phase headings
- timers
- meters
- mechanical state labels

Pauses, silence, and brevity are deliberate narrative tools.

---

### 3.2 Canonical Narrative Beats (Ordered, Optional)

1. Venue & day framing  
2. Rank / stake context  
3. Ring entrance rituals  
4. Shikiri tension  
5. Tachiai impact  
6. Control establishment  
7. Momentum shift(s)  
8. Decisive action  
9. Gyoji ruling  
10. Winning move (kimarite) emphasis  
11. Kenshō ceremony (if present)  
12. Immediate aftermath framing  

Omission of a beat is meaningful and deterministic.

---

## 4. Language Priority Model

Every sentence must map to at least one axis:

1. **Position** — center, drifting, edge, straw  
2. **Balance** — planted, wavering, scrambling  
3. **Intent** — pressing, waiting, adjusting  
4. **Turning Point** — hesitation, grip, angle break  

Forbidden language:
- numbers
- mechanical terms
- probability words
- rarity descriptors

---

## 5. Commentator Voice System

### 5.1 Deterministic Voice Selection
Voice is chosen once per bout based on:
- era preset
- broadcaster identity
- basho day
- rank & narrative stakes

Voice NEVER changes mid‑bout.

---

### 5.2 Voice Styles (Explicit)

**Formal (Traditional / NHK‑like)**  
- short declarative sentences  
- restrained emotion  
- ceremonial authority  

**Dramatic (Late Basho / High Stakes)**  
- rising cadence  
- heightened verbs  
- crowd foregrounded  

**Understated (Early Basho / Analytical)**  
- neutral phrasing  
- implication over emphasis  

Voice affects cadence and adjective density only.

---

## 6. Regional Broadcast Tone Overlay

Regional tone overlays voice and affects phrasing only.

- **Tokyo (Ryōgoku):** authoritative, historical, restrained  
- **Osaka / Nagoya:** warmer, momentum‑focused, reactive  
- **Fukuoka:** intimate, expressive, crowd‑forward  

Tone never alters facts or outcomes.

---

## 7. Ring Entrance & Ritual Layer

### 7.1 Ritual Eligibility
Entrance narration may appear when:
- bout is sekitori‑level
- rivalry or late‑basho stakes exist
- venue tone supports ritual emphasis

---

### 7.2 Ritual Elements (Selective)
- salt toss (shio‑maki)
- foot stamping
- towel handling
- posture & breathing
- eye contact
- crowd hush

Rules:
- concise
- atmospheric
- never padded
- never identical unless deterministically required

---

## 8. Crowd Reaction System

### 8.1 Hidden Crowd State
Tracked internally:
- anticipation
- tension
- surprise
- release

Derived from rank gap, rivalry, venue memory, and outcome shock.

---

### 8.2 Narrative Crowd Reactions
Expressed as:
- murmurs
- gasps
- rising noise
- eruptions
- silence

Silence is a deliberate narrative beat.

---

## 9. Persistent Crowd Memory System

### 9.1 Scope
Tracked **per venue**:
- rikishi
- stables
- notable oyakata

Memory is never erased — only diluted.

---

### 9.2 Memory Dimensions (Hidden)
- favorability
- trust
- expectation
- overexposure

Decay is slow and uneven.

---

### 9.3 Narrative Effects
Memory influences:
- timing of reactions
- warmth vs skepticism
- pressure framing

---

## 10. Special Ruling Narrative Branches

### Mono‑ii
- gyoji hesitation
- judges enter
- hall falls silent
- formal ruling delivered

### Torinaoshi
- continuation, not reset
- fatigue implied
- tighter narration

### Mizui‑iri
- ritual pause
- respectful quiet
- stiffness emphasized post‑break

---

## 11. Winning Move (Kimarite) Emphasis

Every bout MUST explicitly acknowledge the winning move.

Rules:
- framed as execution, not selection
- culturally accurate phrasing
- reinforces stylistic identity

Each kimarite has a **dedicated descriptor pool**.

---

## 12. Sponsor & Kenshō Ceremony Layer

### 12.1 Sponsor Identity Slots
Optional placeholders:
- sponsorName
- sponsorCategory

Rules:
- neutral phrasing
- no brand tone
- no monetary reference

---

### 12.2 Kenshō Ceremony Sequence
Occurs after ruling & kimarite emphasis:

1. banners lowered  
2. envelopes presented  
3. rikishi acknowledgment  
4. crowd response  

Crowd memory updates AFTER ceremony.

---

## 13. Descriptor Variety & De‑Duplication Engine

### 13.1 Descriptor Sets
Each narrative beat owns a **Descriptor Set**.

Selection uses a deterministic hash of:
- boutId
- rikishiId(s)
- venueId
- voice
- tone
- crowd memory
- phrase usage history

---

### 13.2 Phrase Cooldown
- phrases have cooldown windows
- recently used phrases deprioritized
- least‑recently‑used selected if needed

---

### 13.3 Synonym Clusters
Semantically equivalent phrases grouped into clusters.

Only one cluster per beat.
Cluster selection is deterministic.

---

### 13.4 Guardrails
Forbidden:
- mixed tones
- adjective stacking
- metaphor drift
- contradictory reactions

---

## 14. Backend Fidelity (Hidden Contract)

Combat Engine V3 resolves:
1. Tachiai initiative  
2. Grip & stance  
3. Momentum & fatigue  
4. Position drift  
5. Finisher window  
6. Counter legality  
7. Kimarite selection  
8. Special ruling legality  

PBP consumes **resolved outputs only**.

---

## 15. Canonical Sample PBP Bout (Complete)

**Honbasho:** Kyushu Basho  
**Day:** 13  
**Division:** Makuuchi  
**Venue:** Fukuoka  
**Voice:** Dramatic  

**East Maegashira 3 — Kiryuzan**  
**West Komusubi — Hoshitora**

> “Day Thirteen in Fukuoka, and the hall is already alive.”  
> “Kiryuzan steps forward, lifting the salt high before casting it across the ring.”  
> “Hoshitora follows, stamping the clay, eyes fixed ahead.”  
> “The banners from [Sponsor Name] frame the dohyo as the crowd settles.”  
> “They crouch at the shikiri‑sen.”  
> “The fan drops—*tachiai!*”  
> “They crash together—the sound ripples through the hall!”  
> “Hoshitora presses—Kiryuzan bends but does not break.”  
> “A murmur spreads—he has the belt.”  
> “They drift toward the edge—voices rising!”  
> “A hesitation—just enough!”  
> “Kiryuzan drives through with **a textbook yorikiri!**”  
> “Out!”  
> “The hall erupts!”  
> “The banners are lowered.”  
> “The envelopes are presented, one by one.”  
> “Kiryuzan receives the kenshō with a measured bow.”

---

## 16. Canonical Lock‑In Principles

- Ritual precedes combat  
- The move defines the memory  
- Silence is meaningful  
- Ceremony completes victory  
- Numbers never appear
