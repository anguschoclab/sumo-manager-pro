# Stable Lords — NPC Manager AI System v1.2  
## Rivalries, Meta Interpretation, Governance Pressure & Adaptive Behavior (Canonical)

Date: 2026-01-06  
Status: Canonical, verbose, implementation-ready  
Supersedes: NPC Manager AI System v1.1  

Scope:  
This document defines **NPC manager (oyakata) AI behavior** in Stable Lords, fully integrating:

- Rivalry systems (rikishi, oyakata, stable)
- Meta drift interpretation
- Economic and governance pressure
- Scandals, media scrutiny, and sanctions
- Succession and long-term institutional planning

This is the **definitive behavioral contract** for all non-player stables.

---

## 1. Design Philosophy

NPC managers are:
- rational but biased
- strategic but emotional
- deterministic, not optimal
- shaped by memory and rivalry

They do not cheat.  
They do not see hidden values.  
They act on **perceived reality**, not ground truth.

> The AI does not play the game.  
> It defends an institution.

---

## 2. NPC Manager Profile (Recap)

Each NPC manager has immutable traits:

- Risk Tolerance
- Strategic Horizon (short ↔ long)
- Tradition Bias
- Innovation Bias
- Welfare Sensitivity
- Governance Deference
- Rivalry Sensitivity (NEW)

These traits bias decisions but never override rules.

---

## 3. Rivalry System Integration (NEW)

NPC managers participate in **three concurrent rivalry layers**:

1. Rikishi ↔ Rikishi (micro, tactical)
2. Oyakata ↔ Oyakata (strategic, political)
3. Stable ↔ Stable (institutional, inheritable)

Rivalries are **stateful, accumulated, and deterministic**.

---

## 4. How NPCs Perceive Rivalries

NPCs do **not** see numeric rivalry intensity.

Instead, they perceive:
- rivalry state (recognized / heated / bitter / defining)
- dominant side (if any)
- recent trend (cooling / escalating)

This perception alters **decision weighting**, not outcomes.

---

## 5. Rivalry Effects on AI Decision-Making

### 5.1 Recruitment Bias

When stable rivalry ≥ Heated:
- NPCs overweight recruits that counter rival styles
- Will overpay or accept riskier prospects
- Foreign-slot decisions skew toward rivalry counters

This can harm long-term efficiency.

---

### 5.2 Training & Development Bias

Under rivalry pressure:
- training focus narrows
- welfare risk tolerance increases
- innovation may be delayed or rushed (profile-dependent)

Traditionalists double down.  
Gamblers overcorrect.  

---

### 5.3 Economic Risk Bias

NPCs facing rivals:
- accept lower runway thresholds
- delay cost-cutting
- are more likely to take supporter loans

Rivalry does not unlock new options — it **distorts timing**.

---

## 6. Meta Drift Interpretation Under Rivalry

Meta drift signals are filtered through rivalry:

- Rival success is overweighted
- Losses to rivals trigger faster adaptation
- Non-rival trends are discounted

This explains:
- why some stables chase the wrong meta
- why others resist change too long

This is intentional and canonical.

---

## 7. Governance & Scandal Interaction

Rivalry increases:
- likelihood of sanctions escalating
- severity of media tone
- scrutiny under council review

NPCs under rivalry pressure are more likely to:
- ignore early warnings
- gamble on last-minute rescues
- resist mergers with rivals

---

## 8. Succession Planning Under Rivalry

NPC managers:
- accelerate succession when rivalry is being lost
- delay retirement when rivalry is competitive
- block successors linked to rival stables

Succession failure under rivalry increases closure risk.

---

## 9. AI Behavior Tables (Rivalry-Aware)

### 9.1 Strategic Response to Bitter Rivalry

| AI Profile | Typical Response |
|---|---|
| Traditionalist | Philosophy lock-in |
| Survivor | Defensive contraction |
| Talent Factory | Long-term counter build |
| Star Chaser | Prestige-driven overinvestment |
| Gambler | High-risk escalation |

---

### 9.2 Merger Willingness Modifier

| Rivalry State | Merger Acceptance |
|---|---|
| None | Normal |
| Heated | Reluctant |
| Bitter | Very Low |
| Defining | Refusal unless forced |

---

## 10. Interaction with Rikishi-Level Rivalries

NPCs:
- schedule training intensity around rivalry bouts
- protect star rikishi more aggressively
- tolerate higher injury risk in defining rivalries

They never force a loss or win.

---

## 11. Long-Term Memory & Institutional Bias

NPCs remember:
- historic rivals
- humiliating defeats
- forced mergers
- council interventions

This memory persists across:
- generations
- leadership changes
- roster turnover

This is how eras form.

---

## 12. Player vs NPC Fairness Contract

NPC AI:
- uses the same systems as players
- sees the same information (plus institutional memory)
- does not receive hidden buffs

Its advantage comes from **continuity**, not cheating.

---

## 13. Determinism Contract

Given identical:
- world seed
- outcomes
- player actions

NPC behavior is identical.

No randomness.  
No hidden dice.

---

## 14. Canon One-Liners

- **On NPC AI:**  
  > “The AI does not try to win — it tries not to be erased.”

- **On rivalry:**  
  > “Rivalries do not change what is possible. They change what is attempted.”
