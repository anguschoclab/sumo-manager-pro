Status: **Definitive Canon**  
Supersedes:
- Economy & Prestige v1.0–v1.5
- Governance V1.0–V1.3
- All intermediate economy / governance drafts

Scope:  
This document is the **single, harmonized source of truth** for how **money, prestige, governance, scandals, loans, supporters, kabu, mergers, and closures** function together in Stable Lords.

No features from prior documents are removed.  
Conflicts are resolved explicitly.  
All systems are deterministic, explainable, and replay-safe.

# PART I — ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS

## 1. Core Economic Philosophy

- Money is a **constraint**, not a score
- Prestige is a **force multiplier**, not currency
- Institutions survive via **stars, supporters, and sacrifice**
- Governance exists to protect legitimacy, not convenience

> Rank pays the wrestler.  
> Supporters sustain the stable.  
> Governance decides who is allowed to continue.

---

## 2. Currency & Time Cadence

- Currency: ¥ (yen-equivalent)
- No inflation by default
- Cadence:
  - **Weekly**: beya operating costs
  - **Monthly**: salaries, allowances, oyakata salaries, kōenkai income, loan payments
  - **Per-bout**: kenshō settlement
  - **Basho-end**: awards, promotions, prestige decay, governance review

---

## 3. Economic Accounts (Non-Mergeable)

- LeagueTreasury (abstract)
- BeyaOperatingFund
- RikishiCash
- RikishiRetirementFund
- OyakataPersonalFund

Funds never move between accounts unless explicitly defined.

# PART II — RIKISHI PAY & PRESTIGE

## 4. Rikishi Salaries (League-Paid, Monthly)

| Rank | Monthly Salary |
|---|---:|
| Yokozuna | ¥3,000,000 |
| Ōzeki | ¥2,500,000 |
| Sekiwake | ¥1,800,000 |
| Komusubi | ¥1,700,000 |
| Maegashira | ¥1,400,000 |
| Jūryō | ¥1,100,000 |

- Paid monthly
- Never enters beya funds
- 10% automatically diverted to retirement fund

---

## 5. Lower Division Allowances (Monthly)

|---|---:|
| Makushita | ¥150,000 |
| Sandanme | ¥90,000 |
| Jonidan | ¥55,000 |
| Jonokuchi | ¥35,000 |

Purpose: subsistence, not accumulation.

---

## 6. Kenshō Banners

- ¥70,000 per banner
- 50% → rikishi
- 50% → beya operating fund
- Paid immediately per bout
- 30% of rikishi share diverted to retirement fund

Banner counts are deterministic based on prestige, bout importance, and basho context.

---

## 7. Prestige System (Unified)

Prestige exists at:
- Rikishi level
- Beya level

Prestige drives:
- kenshō frequency
- kōenkai strength
- recruitment quality
- narrative prominence
- AI valuation

Decay (per basho):
- Rikishi: 2–4%
- Beya: 1–2%
- Floors apply

---

# PART III — BEYA ECONOMY

## 8. Beya Operating Costs (Weekly)

| Expense | Formula |
|---|---|
| Wrestlers | ¥2,000 × roster |
| Staff | ¥6,000 × staff |
| Facilities | ¥1,000 × facility levels |

These costs are unavoidable.

---

## 9. Retirement Funds

Sources:
- 10% of salary/allowance
- 30% of kenshō winnings

Uses at retirement:
- cash payout
- coaching certification
- kabu acquisition
- succession buy-in

Funds are locked until retirement.

---

# PART IV — SUPPORTERS, OYAKATA & RESCUE

## 10. Kōenkai / Supporters Associations

| Strength | Monthly Income |
|---|---:|
| None | ¥0 |
| Weak | ¥50,000 |
| Moderate | ¥150,000 |
| Strong | ¥400,000 |
| Powerful | ¥800,000 |

Strength evolves deterministically with prestige, success, scandal, and leadership stability.

---

## 11. Oyakata Economics

### 11.1 Oyakata JSA Salary (Monthly)

| Status | Salary |
|---|---:|
| Standard Oyakata | ¥1,000,000 |
| Senior Committee | ¥1,300,000 |
| Executive (Riji) | ¥1,600,000+ |

Paid to OyakataPersonalFund.

---

### 11.2 Personal Subsidies

- Optional
- Triggered at Stressed / Critical
- Monthly cap (¥100k–¥500k)
- Finite
- No prestige gain

Overuse weakens succession and increases collapse risk.

---

## 12. Loans & Benefactors (Insolvency Rescue)

Available only at **Critical** or **Insolvent**.

### Loan Types
1. Emergency Loan (0%, short-term, restrictive)
2. Supporter Loan (2–4%, medium-term, autonomy loss)
3. Benefactor Bailout (5–8%, long-term, governance leverage)

Missed payments escalate deterministically to sanctions, mergers, or closure.

Loans apply **binding strings** and prestige penalties.

---

# PART V — GOVERNANCE & SCANDALS

## 13. Kabu (Elder Stock)

- Finite global pool
- Required to operate a beya
- Non-dividend
- Revocable under sanction
- Escrowed during succession or merger

Loss of kabu = immediate loss of eligibility.

---

## 14. Council Decision Engine

Triggers:
- Insolvency
- Loan default
- Scandal thresholds
- Succession failure
- Welfare violations

Pipeline:
1. Trigger detected
2. State snapshot
3. Rule evaluation
4. Mandatory ruling
5. Media narrative
6. Permanent record

No randomness.

---

## 15. Scandals & Ethics

Scandals accumulate as state:
- Financial misconduct
- Ethical violations
- Institutional misrepresentation
- Narrative exposure

Thresholds trigger:
- Council Watch
- Investigation
- Crisis
- Structural action

---

## 16. Sanction Ladder

1. Warning
2. Fines
3. Restrictions
4. Forced change
5. Merger or closure

Scandals accelerate but never bypass steps.

---

## 17. Media & Narrative Layer

Media translates governance rulings into:
- headlines
- investigations
- retrospectives

Media effects:
- prestige decay acceleration
- kōenkai weakening
- recruitment penalties

Media never invents outcomes.

---

## 18. Governance UI & History

Every beya has:
- live governance status panel
- visible sanctions and restrictions
- permanent ruling ledger

No hidden punishments. No surprise closures.

---

# PART VI — STRUCTURAL OUTCOMES

## 19. Stable Mergers

Deterministic resolution:
- surviving beya selected
- facilities partially absorbed
- roster conflicts resolved
- prestige partially transferred
- identity retired

Scandal reduces favorable outcomes.

---

## 20. Forced Closures

Triggered by:
- kabu loss
- unrecoverable insolvency
- terminal scandal

Closure is permanent and archived.

---

## 21. AI Behavior Summary

AI managers:
- track runway, scandal risk, governance status
- adjust spending and training
- plan succession earlier under pressure
- may resign pre-removal

Profiles affect timing, not rules.

---

## 22. Determinism Contract

Given identical:
- seed
- decisions
- timelines

Outcomes are identical.

---

## 23. Final Canon Statement

> **Stable Lords is not about winning bouts.  
> It is about whether an institution deserves to survive the consequences of winning them.**

---
