## Narrative‑First, Fully‑Specified, Implementation Canon

Date: 2026‑01‑06  
Status: **Definitive Canon**  
Supersedes:
- Clean Canon v1.2 — Full Verbose
- Clean Canon v1.3 — Narrative‑First Edition

## How This Document Is Structured

This document **merges the full mechanical completeness of v1.2** with the **explicit narrative‑first presentation contract of v1.3**.

**Rule of precedence inside this document:**
- Mechanical rules from v1.2 are preserved unless explicitly overridden.
- Presentation, UI, and player‑facing interpretation follow the narrative‑first rules below.
- Internal simulation remains numeric and deterministic at all times.

If a conflict exists:
> **Mechanics stay numeric. Presentation becomes narrative.**

---

# 0. Narrative‑First Presentation Contract (Binding)

Stable Lords is not presented as a spreadsheet simulation.  
It is presented as a **living chronicle of sumo institutions, careers, and decline**.

### 0.1 Engine vs Player Reality
- The engine uses precise numbers.
- The player consumes **language, tone, trends, and consequence**.
- Numbers appear only where money, rank, or time demand them.

> “The truth exists underneath. The player lives on the surface.”

### 0.2 Where Numbers Are Allowed
Raw numbers may appear **only** in:
- Economy ledgers (yen, salaries, debts, runway)
- Rankings & records (wins/losses, rank titles)
- Time (basho count, days, weeks)

All other values must be:
- banded
- comparative
- trend‑based
- described verbally

### 0.3 Forbidden Numeric Leakage
Never expose raw values for:
- attributes
- fatigue, morale, injury risk
- growth ceilings
- rivalry heat
- prestige
- governance thresholds
- AI confidence or intent

Breaking this rule is a design bug.

---

# 1. Core Vision & Pillars

(From v1.2, clarified narratively)

### Pillar 1 — Authentic Institutions
Sumo is:
- conservative
- hierarchical
- political
- tradition‑bound

Rules are inferred through outcomes, not tooltips.

### Pillar 2 — Deterministic Simulation
Nothing is random.
Everything is reproducible under seed + state + choice.

### Pillar 3 — Emergent Narrative
The game never scripts drama.
It **remembers** it.

### Pillar 4 — Always Playable
The game must always boot, load, and remain navigable, even with dormant systems.

# 2. Canonical Tech Stack
*(Unchanged from v1.2 — authoritative)*

[Full tech stack preserved verbatim]

---

# 3. Determinism Rules
*(Unchanged from v1.2 — authoritative)*

- World Seed
- Deterministic divergence
- Forbidden nondeterminism

---

# 4. World Structure & Time
*(Unchanged from v1.2, harmonized with World Generation Contract)*

- ~42 stables, flexible bounds
- 6 basho per year
- day‑based basho, week‑based interim

---

# 5. Beya System
*(Preserved mechanically, narrated institutionally)*

Founding, succession, closure, and mergers remain **rule‑driven**, but surfaced as:
- council deliberations
- lineage stories
- institutional failure or survival arcs

---

# 6. Rikishi Identity & Career System
*(Full v1.2 mechanics retained)*

### 6.1 Permanent Identity
- Immutable ID
- Unique shikona (registry‑enforced)
- Origin metadata

### 6.2 Career Phases
Youth → Rise → Prime → Decline → Exit

Phases are **never shown numerically**.
They are implied through:
- commentary
- consistency
- recovery speed
- narrative framing

---

# 7. Physique, Fatigue, Momentum & Injuries
*(Full mechanical model retained)*

### Presentation Rule
Players never see:
- fatigue values
- injury probabilities
- momentum numbers

Instead they see:
- body language
- form commentary
- recovery notes
- visible injuries with timelines

---

# 8. Combat Engine V3
*(Mechanically identical to v1.2)*

### Narrative Override
Combat logs are rendered as **story beats**:
- tachiai clash
- control shift
- decisive moment
- finish framing

The kimarite remains official; execution is narrated.

---

# 9. Banzuke & Rankings
*(Unchanged mechanically)*

- Authentic hierarchy
- Deterministic promotion heuristics
- Records shown numerically (allowed)

Narrative framing emphasizes:
- pressure
- expectation
- consequences of rank

---

# 10. 82‑Kimarite System
*(Fully preserved from v1.2)*

Registry, weighting matrices, stance biases, and tokui‑waza mechanics remain unchanged.

**Presentation rule:**  
Players learn tendencies through repetition and commentary, not probability tables.

---

# 11. Economy, Prestige & Rivalries

### 11.1 Economy (Numeric Core)
Salaries, kenshō, debt, loans, runway remain explicit numbers.

### 11.2 Prestige (Narrative Scalar)
Prestige is **never shown numerically**.
It is implied via:
- banner frequency
- media tone
- recruitment ease
- governance attention

### 11.3 Rivalries
Rivalry heat is hidden.
Importance is conveyed via:
- headline frequency
- commentary language
- crowd reaction
- AI behavior shifts

---

# 12. Scouting & Fog‑of‑War

*(Mechanics preserved; presentation narrative)*

Scouting reports read like analyst notes:
- “Appears vulnerable late.”
- “Struggles on the belt.”
- “Condition seems inconsistent.”

Confidence is verbal, not numeric.

---

# 13. Narrative Consumption Layer

Narrative is a **consumer**, never a driver.

Inputs:
- bout logs
- rivalries
- seasonal tone
- injuries
- governance events

Outputs:
- headlines
- journals
- retrospectives
- commentary

All deterministic.

---

# 14. Data Contracts & Helpers
*(Preserved from v1.2)*

Types, helpers, kimarite registry remain authoritative.

---

# 15. Forward‑Declared Systems
*(Preserved and aligned with narrative contract)*

- Governance V1
- Mergers
- Loans & benefactors
- Career journals & analytics

Dormant systems may produce **narrative signals only**, never hidden outcomes.

---

# 16. Final Developer Contract

Internally:
- numbers are precise
- logs are exact
- determinism is absolute

Externally:
- the player sees meaning, not machinery
- uncertainty is explicit
- explanation follows consequence

> “You don’t manage numbers. You manage consequences.”
