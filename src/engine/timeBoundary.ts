// Time Boundary Orchestrator — explicit interim weekly tick ordering.
//
// Canon goals:
// - One authoritative ordering for interim (between-basho) simulation steps.
// - Deterministic: each subsystem derives its RNG from world.seed.
// - Produces structured "boundary events" that UI can digest later.
